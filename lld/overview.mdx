## What is Low Level Design?

Low Level Design (LLD) focuses on the **internal implementation** of a system. While High Level Design (HLD) covers architecture and component interactions, LLD deals with:

- **Class diagrams** and object relationships
- **Design patterns** and their applications
- **API contracts** and method signatures
- **Data structures** for specific features
- **Code organization** and modularity

## Why LLD Matters for Interviews

LLD interviews test your ability to:

## LLD Interview Approach

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clarify Requirements (2-3 min)">
    Ask questions to understand scope, users, and core features
  </Step>
  <Step title="Identify Core Objects (5 min)">
    List the main entities/classes and their responsibilities
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define Relationships (5 min)">
    Establish inheritance, composition, and associations
  </Step>
  <Step title="Design APIs (10 min)">
    Define key methods and their signatures
  </Step>
  <Step title="Handle Edge Cases (5 min)">
    Consider concurrency, error handling, extensibility
  </Step>
  <Step title="Apply Patterns (ongoing)">
    Use design patterns where appropriate
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Quick Reference: Design Patterns

### Creational Patterns

```python
# Singleton - Single instance
class Database:
    _instance = None
    
    def __new__(cls):
        if cls._instance is None:
            cls._instance = super().__new__(cls)
        return cls._instance

# Factory - Create objects without specifying class
class VehicleFactory:
    @staticmethod
    def create(type: str) -> Vehicle:
        if type == "car":
            return Car()
        elif type == "bike":
            return Bike()
```

### Structural Patterns

```python
# Adapter - Make incompatible interfaces work together
class LegacyPrinter:
    def print_old(self, text):
        print(f"Old: {text}")

class PrinterAdapter:
    def __init__(self, legacy: LegacyPrinter):
        self.legacy = legacy
    
    def print(self, text):
        self.legacy.print_old(text)
```

### Behavioral Patterns

```python
# Strategy - Interchangeable algorithms
class PaymentContext:
    def __init__(self, strategy: PaymentStrategy):
        self.strategy = strategy
    
    def pay(self, amount):
        return self.strategy.process(amount)

# Observer - Notify dependents of changes
class Subject:
    def __init__(self):
        self._observers = []
    
    def attach(self, observer):
        self._observers.append(observer)
    
    def notify(self, event):
        for observer in self._observers:
            observer.update(event)
```

<Tip>
**Interview Tip**: Always start with the simplest design that works, then extend. Interviewers prefer seeing your thought process over a perfect initial design.
