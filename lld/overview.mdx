## 🚀 What is Low Level Design?

Low Level Design (LLD) is the **bridge between system architecture and working code**. While High Level Design (HLD) answers "what components do we need?", LLD answers "how do we implement each component with clean, maintainable, extensible code?".

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Classes & Objects" icon="cubes" color="#3b82f6">
    Design classes, interfaces, and their relationships using OOP principles
  </Card>
  <Card title="Design Patterns" icon="puzzle-piece" color="#8b5cf6">
    Apply proven Gang of Four solutions to common problems
  </Card>
  <Card title="Clean Code" icon="wand-magic-sparkles" color="#10b981">
    Write maintainable, extensible, testable code using SOLID
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
**LLD vs HLD**: HLD deals with services, databases, and infrastructure at 10,000 feet. LLD zooms into a single service to design classes, methods, and code structure. Master both for complete system design interviews!

    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Phase 1: Requirements">
    **Ask these questions BEFORE designing:**
    
    1. **Scope**: What are the core features? What's out of scope?
    2. **Users**: Who are the actors? (Customer, Admin, System)
    3. **Scale**: Single instance or distributed?
    4. **Constraints**: Any specific tech requirements?
    
    **Example for Parking Lot:**
    - How many floors? Types of vehicles?
    - Multiple entry/exit points?
    - Payment methods needed?
    - Real-time availability display?
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Phase 2: Core Design">
    **Follow this checklist:**
    
    1. **List Nouns** → These become your classes
    2. **List Verbs** → These become your methods
    3. **Identify Relationships**:
       - Is-A (Inheritance)
       - Has-A (Composition/Aggregation)
       - Uses (Dependency)
    4. **Draw Class Diagram** with key attributes and methods
    5. **Define Interfaces** for polymorphic behavior
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Phase 3: Deep Dive">
    **Implementation priorities:**
    
    1. Start with **core happy path**
    2. Apply **SOLID principles** as you code
    3. Identify and apply **design patterns**:
       - Factory for object creation
       - Strategy for interchangeable algorithms
       - Observer for event handling
       - State for complex state machines
    4. Handle **edge cases**:
       - Null/empty inputs
       - Concurrent access
       - Resource exhaustion
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Phase 4: Discussion">
    **Be ready to discuss:**
    
    - Why did you choose X over Y?
    - How would you add feature Z?
    - What are the trade-offs of your design?
    - How would you handle 10x scale?
    - Where would you add caching/logging?

## 🔧 Quick Reference: Core Concepts

### The Four Pillars of OOP

```python
# ENCAPSULATION - Hide internal state
class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self):
        self.__balance = 0  # Private
    
    def deposit(self, amount):  # Controlled access
        if amount > 0:
            self.__balance += amount

# ABSTRACTION - Hide complexity
class PaymentProcessor(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def process(self, amount): pass  # What, not how

# INHERITANCE - Share behavior
class Car(Vehicle):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()  # Reuse parent

# POLYMORPHISM - Same interface, different behavior
def make_sound(animal: Animal):
    animal.speak()  # Works for Dog, Cat, Bird...
```

### SOLID Principles One-Liners

| Principle | Rule | Example |
|-----------|------|---------|
| **S**ingle Responsibility | One class, one reason to change | `Order` shouldn't send emails |
| **O**pen/Closed | Extend, don't modify | Add new `PaymentMethod`, don't edit old ones |
| **L**iskov Substitution | Subtypes are substitutable | `Penguin` shouldn't break `Bird.fly()` |
| **I**nterface Segregation | Small, focused interfaces | `Readable` vs `ReadableWritable` |
| **D**ependency Inversion | Depend on abstractions | Inject `Database`, not `PostgreSQL` |

### Pattern Quick Reference

```python
# SINGLETON - One instance
class Logger:
    _instance = None
    def __new__(cls):
        if not cls._instance:
            cls._instance = super().__new__(cls)
        return cls._instance

# FACTORY - Create without specifying class
def create_vehicle(type: str) -> Vehicle:
    return {"car": Car, "bike": Bike}[type]()

# STRATEGY - Swappable algorithms
class PaymentContext:
    def __init__(self, strategy: PaymentStrategy):
        self.strategy = strategy
    def pay(self, amount):
        return self.strategy.process(amount)

# OBSERVER - Notify on changes
class Stock:
    def __init__(self):
        self.observers = []
    def notify(self):
        for obs in self.observers:
            obs.update(self)
```

## 💡 Pro Tips for LLD Interviews

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start Simple, Then Extend" icon="seedling">
    Don't try to build the perfect design upfront. Start with core classes that work, then add complexity. Interviewers want to see your iterative thinking.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Think Out Loud" icon="comments">
    Explain your reasoning as you design. "I'm making this an interface because we might have multiple implementations" shows depth.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Ask Clarifying Questions" icon="circle-question">
    Don't assume. Ask about scale, users, and constraints. This shows you think like a senior engineer.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Know Your Patterns" icon="shapes">
    Memorize when to use Factory, Strategy, Observer, and State. These cover 80% of LLD interviews.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Consider Extensibility" icon="puzzle-piece">
    Design so new requirements don't require rewriting. "If we need to add X later, we just create a new class implementing Y."
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Handle Edge Cases" icon="shield-halved">
    Mention concurrency, null checks, and error handling. Even if you don't implement them, show you're aware.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
