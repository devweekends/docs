## Overview

This is a curated list of system design interview questions organized by difficulty and topic. Use this to practice and assess your readiness.

<Tip>

## Sample Interview Questions with Hints

### Question 1: Design a URL Shortener

<Accordion title="Requirements to clarify">
- How many URLs per day? (100M writes, 10B reads)
- How long should URLs be valid? (configurable, default forever)
- Custom short URLs allowed?
- Analytics needed?
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Key design points">
1. **Encoding**: Base62 encoding (a-z, A-Z, 0-9)
2. **ID Generation**: Counter + Base62 or random hash
3. **Storage**: Simple key-value (Redis) + persistent DB
4. **Caching**: Cache popular URLs in Redis
5. **Database**: NoSQL (DynamoDB) works well
</Accordion>

### Question 2: Design Twitter Timeline

<Accordion title="Requirements to clarify">
- Active users? (300M DAU)
- Tweet rate? (500M tweets/day)
- Follow limits? (5000 following)
- Celebrity accounts? (millions of followers)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Key design points">
1. **Fan-out on write**: Pre-compute timelines for most users
2. **Fan-out on read**: For celebrities (too many followers)
3. **Hybrid approach**: Write to cache for most, read-time merge for celebrities
4. **Caching**: Redis sorted sets for timelines
5. **Ranking**: Chronological + engagement signals
</Accordion>

### Question 3: Design WhatsApp

<Accordion title="Requirements to clarify">
- Users? (2B users, 100M DAU)
- Message rate? (100B messages/day)
- Group size? (1024 members max)
- Message types? (text, image, video)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Key design points">
1. **Connection**: WebSocket for real-time
2. **Message flow**: Sender → Server → Recipient (or queue if offline)
3. **Group messages**: Fan-out on server
4. **Delivery status**: Sent → Delivered → Read
5. **Offline handling**: Queue messages, deliver on reconnect
</Accordion>

### Question 4: Design Netflix
