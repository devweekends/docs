## What is System Design?

System Design focuses on the **high-level architecture** of software systems. While LLD deals with classes and code, HLD deals with:

- **Components** and how they interact
- **Scalability** and handling growth
- **Reliability** and fault tolerance
- **Data storage** and retrieval patterns
- **Trade-offs** between different approaches

## Interview Approach

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clarify Requirements (5 min)">
    Ask about users, scale, features, and constraints
  </Step>
  <Step title="High-Level Design (10 min)">
    Draw main components and their interactions
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deep Dive (15 min)">
    Detail specific components, discuss trade-offs
  </Step>
  <Step title="Address Bottlenecks (10 min)">
    Identify and solve scaling challenges
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common Interview Problems

| Problem | Difficulty | Key Concepts |
|---------|------------|--------------|
| URL Shortener | 🟢 Easy | Hashing, Database, Caching |
| Rate Limiter | 🟢 Easy | Token Bucket, Redis |
| Twitter Feed | 🟡 Medium | Fan-out, Timeline, Caching |
| Instagram | 🟡 Medium | CDN, Blob Storage, Feed |
| WhatsApp | 🟡 Medium | WebSockets, Message Queue |
| YouTube | 🔴 Hard | Video Processing, CDN, Storage |
| Google Search | 🔴 Hard | Crawling, Indexing, Ranking |
| Uber | 🔴 Hard | Location, Matching, Real-time |

## Quick Reference: Key Numbers

| Operation | Latency |
|-----------|---------|
| L1 cache reference | 0.5 ns |
| L2 cache reference | 7 ns |
| RAM reference | 100 ns |
| SSD random read | 150 μs |
| HDD seek | 10 ms |
| Network round trip (same datacenter) | 0.5 ms |
| Network round trip (cross-continent) | 150 ms |

| Scale | Number |
|-------|--------|
| Seconds in a day | 86,400 |
| Seconds in a month | 2.6 million |
| QPS from 1M daily users | ~12 QPS |
| QPS from 100M daily users | ~1,200 QPS |

<Tip>
**Interview Tip**: Always start with requirements and estimations. Interviewers want to see your thought process, not just the final design.
