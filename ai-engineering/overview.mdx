## The $500K+ Skill in 2025

AI Engineers are the highest-paid developers in tech right now. According to [Levels.fyi](https://levels.fyi), senior AI Engineers at top companies earn **$400K-$700K+ TC**. Why? Because companies are desperate for people who can actually **ship** AI products—not just experiment with ChatGPT.

<Info>
**December 2025 Update**: This course now covers GPT-4.5, Claude 3.5 Opus, Gemini 2.0 Flash, the OpenAI Responses API, and the latest agentic patterns including computer use and MCP integrations.
</Info>

This isn't another "prompt engineering" course. You'll build **real systems**:
- A production RAG pipeline that handles 100K+ documents with hybrid search
- Multi-agent systems with LangGraph that automate complex workflows  
- MCP servers that connect AI to databases, APIs, and external tools
- AI applications with proper error handling, caching, and observability

<Note>
**What makes this different?** Every module includes production code you can deploy. No toy examples. No "hello world" chatbots.
</Note>

### What Companies Are Building Right Now

| Company Type | AI Applications | Your Skills |
