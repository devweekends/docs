## The $500K Skill

AI Engineers are the highest-paid developers in 2025. Companies are desperate for people who can actually **ship** AI products—not just play with ChatGPT.

This isn't another "prompt engineering" course. You'll build **real systems**:
- A production RAG pipeline that handles 10K+ documents
- Multi-agent systems that automate complex workflows  
- AI applications with proper error handling, caching, and observability

<Note>
**What makes this different?** Every module includes production code you can deploy. No toy examples. No "hello world" chatbots.
</Note>

## Learning Path

<Steps>
  <Step title="Week 0: Prerequisites (Optional)">
    **For those new to Python/Backend**
    
    - Python crash course: async, types, classes
    - FastAPI: APIs, streaming, dependency injection
    - Databases: PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, migrations
    
    **Skip if**: You already know Python and have built APIs
  </Step>
  <Step title="Week 1-2: Foundations">
    **Goal**: Understand LLMs deeply, not superficially.
    
    - How transformers and attention work
    - Tokenization, context windows, and costs
    - Embeddings and semantic similarity
    - Prompt engineering that actually works
    
    **Project**: Build a cost-aware chat application
  </Step>
  <Step title="Week 3-4: APIs & Tool Use">
    **Goal**: Master the OpenAI API beyond basics.
    
    - Streaming responses for real-time UX
    - Function calling for structured actions
    - Structured outputs with Pydantic
    - Vision and multimodal inputs
    
    **Project**: AI Code Reviewer that analyzes GitHub PRs
  </Step>
  <Step title="Week 5-6: Vector Search & RAG">
    **Goal**: Build RAG systems that don't suck.
    
    - Chunking strategies that preserve context
    - Hybrid search (semantic + keyword)
    - Re-ranking for precision
    - Evaluation and continuous improvement
    
    **Project**: Production document Q&A system
  </Step>
  <Step title="Week 7-8: Agents & Production">
    **Goal**: Deploy AI systems that scale.
    
    - Agent architectures and patterns
    - LangGraph for complex workflows
    - MCP for tool integration
    - Caching, rate limiting, observability
    
    **Project**: Multi-agent research assistant
