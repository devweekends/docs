## 🔌 API Design

### Endpoint Groups

**Domain 1 (e.g., Users)**
| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/api/auth/register` | Create new user |
| `POST` | `/api/auth/login` | Authenticate user |
| `GET` | `/api/users/me` | Get current user profile |

**Domain 2 (e.g., Core Resource)**
| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/api/resources` | List resources with pagination |
| `POST` | `/api/resources` | Create new resource |
| `GET` | `/api/resources/:id` | Get single resource |
| `PATCH` | `/api/resources/:id` | Update resource |
| `DELETE` | `/api/resources/:id` | Delete resource |

## 🗄️ Database Design

```mermaid
erDiagram
    User ||--o{ Resource : creates
    User {
        uuid id PK
        string email UK
        string password_hash
        datetime created_at
    }
    Resource ||--|{ SubResource : contains
    Resource {
        uuid id PK
        uuid user_id FK
        string title
        text content
        enum status
    }
    SubResource {
        uuid id PK
        uuid resource_id FK
        string data
    }
```

### Key Design Decisions
- **Decision 1**: Why we structured data this way
- **Decision 2**: Indexing strategy for performance
- **Decision 3**: Any denormalization trade-offs
