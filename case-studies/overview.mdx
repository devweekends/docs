## 📝 What is a Case Study?

A case study is a **professional write-up** that documents your engineering project from start to finish. It showcases your technical decision-making, architecture choices, and problem-solving skills to potential employers and mentors.

<Info>
**Why Write Case Studies?** They're like a portfolio for engineers - 10x more impressive than just having code on GitHub. Recruiters and hiring managers LOVE candidates who can articulate their technical decisions clearly.

## 💡 Pro Tips

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Keep it Concise" icon="scissors">
    4-8 pages is the sweet spot. Link out to code rather than pasting large snippets.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Show Trade-offs" icon="scale-balanced">
    Don't just say what you did - explain WHY and what alternatives you considered.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Include Metrics" icon="chart-line">
    Numbers make your case study credible: latency, throughput, error rates, team size, timeline.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use Diagrams" icon="diagram-project">
    Architecture diagrams and ERDs are worth 1000 words. Use Mermaid for consistency.
