## Why Learn Engineering Fundamentals?

Strong engineering fundamentals separate good developers from great ones. These topics help you:

- **Design** scalable and maintainable systems
- **Debug** complex issues efficiently
- **Communicate** technical decisions clearly
- **Excel** in system design interviews
- **Build** production-ready applications

<Note>
**Career Impact**: Engineers with strong fundamentals are 3x more likely to be promoted to senior roles and consistently outperform in technical interviews at top companies.

## Learning Path

<Steps>
  <Step title="Foundation (Week 1-2)">
    Start with **CS Fundamentals** - understand how computers, networks, and databases work at a fundamental level. Master processes, threads, TCP/IP, and ACID properties.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Design Principles (Week 3-4)">
    Master **SOLID principles**, **Design Patterns**, and **Clean Code** practices. These form the foundation of all good software.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Architecture (Week 5-6)">
    Learn different **architecture patterns** (Monolith, Microservices, Event-Driven) and when to apply each. Understand trade-offs and DDD concepts.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Operations (Week 7-8)">
    Dive into **DevOps**, **Security**, and **Performance** optimization for production-ready systems. Learn CI/CD, monitoring, and scaling strategies.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
**Pro Tip**: Don't just read about these concepts—build projects that use them. Hands-on experience solidifies understanding. Try implementing a small e-commerce system applying all these concepts.
</Tip>

<Warning>
**Common Mistake**: Trying to learn everything at once. Focus on fundamentals first, then progressively add complexity. Master one topic before moving to the next.
</Warning>
