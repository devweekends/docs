## What Makes This Course Different

<Note>
This isn't a rehash of OS textbooks. We focus on:
- **Interview-relevant depth**: What senior engineers actually get asked
- **Linux-specific implementation**: Real code, not abstract theory
- **Production perspective**: How these concepts impact real systems
- **Trade-off discussions**: The nuanced thinking senior roles require
