## 1. MongoDB Fundamentals

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is MongoDB and its key features?">
    MongoDB is a NoSQL document database that stores data in flexible JSON-like documents. Key features include schema flexibility, horizontal scalability, rich query language, indexing support, aggregation framework, and replication for high availability.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Explain BSON vs JSON">
    BSON (Binary JSON) is MongoDB's binary-encoded format. It extends JSON with additional data types like Date, Binary, ObjectId, and provides more efficient encoding/decoding and traversal.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are collections and documents?">
    Collections are groups of MongoDB documents, similar to tables in relational databases. Documents are records in BSON format, consisting of field-value pairs with flexible schemas.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Explain CRUD operations">
    **Create**: `insertOne()`, `insertMany()`. **Read**: `find()`, `findOne()`. **Update**: `updateOne()`, `updateMany()`, `replaceOne()`. **Delete**: `deleteOne()`, `deleteMany()`. These operations form the foundation of MongoDB interactions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is the _id field?">
    The `_id` field is the primary key in MongoDB documents, automatically generated as ObjectId if not provided. It's unique within a collection and indexed by default for fast lookups.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<hr />

## 2. MongoDB Advanced Concepts

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is indexing?">
    Indexing creates data structures for faster queries. Types include single field, compound, multikey, text, and geospatial indexes. Indexes improve query performance but increase write overhead and storage.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Explain aggregation framework">
    Aggregation processes data through a pipeline of stages like `$match`, `$group`, `$project`, `$sort`, `$lookup`. It enables complex data transformations and analytics directly in the database.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is sharding?">
    Sharding distributes data across multiple servers for horizontal scaling. It enables handling large datasets by partitioning data based on a shard key across multiple shards.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Explain replica sets">
    Replica sets are groups of MongoDB instances maintaining the same data for high availability. They include one primary (writes) and multiple secondaries (replication) with automatic failover.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are embedded vs referenced relationships?">
    **Embedded**: related data within the same document (denormalized). **Referenced**: separate documents linked by IDs (normalized). Choice depends on access patterns and data size.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<hr />

## 3. Express.js Basics

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is Express.js?">
    Express.js is a minimal, flexible Node.js web framework providing robust features for web and mobile applications with a thin layer over Node.js's http module.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Explain middleware">
    Middleware functions have access to `req`, `res`, and `next`. They execute code, modify req/res, end cycles, or call `next()`. Types include application-level, router-level, error-handling, and third-party.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does routing work?">
    Routing defines how applications respond to client requests at specific endpoints (URIs) and HTTP methods. Express provides `app.METHOD(PATH, HANDLER)` syntax for route definition.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are route parameters?">
    Route parameters capture values from URL segments (`/users/:id`) accessible via `req.params`. Query strings (`?key=value`) are accessed via `req.query` for optional parameters.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How to handle POST requests?">
    Use `express.json()` and `express.urlencoded()` middleware to parse request bodies. Access parsed data via `req.body` in route handlers.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<hr />

## 4. Express.js Advanced

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Implement error handling">
    Error middleware has `(err, req, res, next)` signature. Define after all routes. Pass errors with `next(err)`. Handle async errors with try-catch or `express-async-errors`.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is CORS?">
    Cross-Origin Resource Sharing allows/restricts cross-domain requests. Enable with `cors` middleware, configuring origins, methods, headers, and credentials as needed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Explain Express Router">
    Router creates modular, mountable route handlers. It's a mini-app with its own middleware and routes, enabling better code organization and reusability.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How to implement authentication?">
    Common approach: JWT tokens. Verify tokens in middleware, attach user to `req` object. Store tokens client-side, include in Authorization header.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is helmet.js?">
    Helmet sets security-related HTTP headers: X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, Strict-Transport-Security, CSP. Essential for production security.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<hr />

## 5. React Fundamentals

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is React?">
    React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces with component-based architecture, virtual DOM, one-way data flow, and JSX syntax.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Explain JSX">
    JSX is syntax extension allowing HTML-like code in JavaScript. It transpiles to `React.createElement()` calls, providing intuitive UI description with JavaScript expressions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are components?">
    Components are independent, reusable UI pieces. Functional components are preferred: `const MyComponent = (props) => {props.text}`. They accept props and return React elements.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are props?">
    Props are read-only inputs passed from parent to child components. They enable data flow and component communication: `<Component prop="value" />`.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is state?">
    State stores component's dynamic data. Use `useState` hook: `const [count, setCount] = useState(0)`. State updates trigger re-renders. Never mutate state directly.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<hr />

## 6. React Hooks & State Management

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What are React Hooks?">
    Hooks let you use state and lifecycle in functional components. Common hooks: `useState`, `useEffect`, `useContext`, `useReducer`, `useCallback`, `useMemo`, `useRef`.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Explain useState">
    `useState` adds state to functional components: `const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue)`. Returns current state and setter function.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is useEffect?">
    `useEffect` handles side effects: data fetching, subscriptions, DOM manipulation. Runs after render. Dependency array controls when it runs. Return cleanup function.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Explain useContext">
    `useContext` accesses context values without prop drilling: `const value = useContext(MyContext)`. Context provides global state across component tree.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are useCallback and useMemo?">
    `useCallback` memoizes functions, `useMemo` memoizes values. Both optimize performance by preventing unnecessary recalculations when dependencies unchanged.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<hr />

## 7. React Advanced Patterns

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is code splitting?">
    Code splitting breaks bundle into chunks loaded on demand. Use `React.lazy()` for component-level splitting: `const LazyComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./Component'))`.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Explain error boundaries">
    Error boundaries catch JavaScript errors in component tree. Implement with `componentDidCatch` and `getDerivedStateFromError`. Display fallback UI instead of crashing.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are portals?">
    Portals render children outside parent DOM hierarchy: `ReactDOM.createPortal(child, container)`. Useful for modals, tooltips, overlays maintaining React tree relationship.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is React Router?">
    React Router enables client-side routing in SPAs. Define routes with `<Route path="/" element={<Component />} />`. Navigate with `Link` or `useNavigate` hook.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Explain performance optimization">
    Techniques: `React.memo`, `useCallback`, `useMemo`, code splitting, virtualization, lazy loading, avoid inline functions, proper keys, lift state appropriately.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<hr />

## 8. Node.js Core Concepts

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is Node.js?">
    Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on V8 engine, enabling server-side JavaScript. Features: event-driven, non-blocking I/O, single-threaded event loop, NPM ecosystem.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Explain the event loop">
    Event loop enables non-blocking I/O through phases: timers, pending callbacks, poll, check, close. Processes callback queues enabling asynchronous operations.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are Node modules?">
    Modules are reusable code units. Types: core (built-in), local (your files), third-party (npm). Use `require()` (CommonJS) or `import` (ES modules).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Explain callbacks">
    Callbacks are functions passed as arguments, executed after async operations. Callback hell: deeply nested callbacks. Solutions: Promises, async/await.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are Promises?">
    Promises represent eventual completion of async operations. States: pending, fulfilled, rejected. Chain with `.then().catch().finally()`. Better than callbacks.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<hr />

## 9. Node.js Advanced Topics

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is clustering?">
    Clustering spawns multiple Node processes (workers) utilizing multi-core CPUs. Master distributes load across workers for better performance and fault tolerance.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Explain Worker Threads">
    Worker Threads enable parallel JavaScript execution for CPU-intensive tasks. Create with `new Worker()`. Communicate via `postMessage`. Lighter than clustering.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is the fs module?">
    `fs` provides file system operations: `readFile`, `writeFile`, `appendFile`, `unlink`, `mkdir`. Use async versions for non-blocking I/O. Promises API available.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are streams?">
    Streams process data in chunks without loading entirely in memory. Types: Readable, Writable, Duplex, Transform. Pipe data: `readStream.pipe(writeStream)`.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How to debug Node.js?">
    Methods: `console.log`, `node inspect`, Chrome DevTools (`--inspect`), VS Code debugger, `debug` module. Set breakpoints, inspect variables, step through code.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<hr />

## 10. MERN Stack Integration

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Connect MongoDB with Express">
    Use Mongoose: `mongoose.connect(uri)`. Define schemas and models. Use in routes for CRUD operations with async/await.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="API calls from React to Express">
    Use `fetch` or `axios`. Configure proxy in development. Handle loading and error states. Create custom hooks for data fetching.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Structure MERN application">
    `/client` (React), `/server` (Express with `/models`, `/routes`, `/controllers`, `/middleware`), separate `package.json` files. Proxy API calls in development.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="RESTful API design">
    Resource-based URLs, HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), stateless, JSON responses, proper status codes, versioning, pagination, filtering.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Implement authentication">
    Backend: hash passwords (bcrypt), generate JWT on login. Frontend: store token, add to requests, create auth context, protect routes.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<hr />

## 11. Security & Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Common security vulnerabilities">
    XSS, injection attacks, CSRF, broken authentication, sensitive data exposure. Prevent with input validation, sanitization, security headers, HTTPS, proper authentication.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Input validation">
    Backend: `express-validator`, Mongoose validators. Frontend: controlled inputs, validation libraries. Never trust client-side validation alone. Sanitize and validate all input.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="API keys and secrets management">
    Use environment variables, never hardcode. `.env` file for dev (don't commit), platform-specific solutions for production (AWS Secrets Manager). Rotate regularly.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Implement rate limiting">
    Use `express-rate-limit`: limit requests per time window. Different limits for different endpoints. Store in Redis for distributed systems. Prevent abuse.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Error handling best practices">
    Catch errors centrally with error middleware. Log errors, send generic messages to clients. Handle promise rejections. Use error tracking services (Sentry).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
