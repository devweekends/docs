This is a living page. We’ll keep expanding the list. For now, use the strategy below and our link dump in the DevWeekends site.

## Research strategy

1. Target hubs (EU/UK/DE, UAE, Canada, Singapore) and build a list of companies with active engineering teams.
2. Use LinkedIn filters: location, company headcount 50–5,000, and tech stack keywords.
3. Track roles + referrers; personalize outreach to alumni or team members.

We’ll add a structured list here as we ingest more data. Contributions are welcome via PR.
