## 1. Java Fundamentals

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is Java?">
    Java is an object-oriented, platform-independent programming language that runs on the JVM. It follows WORA — Write Once, Run Anywhere — principle.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Explain JVM, JRE, and JDK">
    - **JVM:** Executes Java bytecode.  
    - **JRE:** Contains JVM + core libraries to run Java apps.  
    - **JDK:** Includes JRE + development tools (compiler, debugger).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are access modifiers in Java?">
    `public`, `protected`, `default`, and `private` — control visibility of classes, methods, and variables across packages.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Difference between stack and heap memory?">
    **Stack:** Stores local variables and method calls.  
    **Heap:** Stores objects created using `new`. Managed by garbage collector.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are wrapper classes?">
    Wrapper classes convert primitive types into objects (e.g., `int` → `Integer`). Used in collections and generics.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<hr />

## 2. Object-Oriented Programming

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What are the main OOP principles?">
    - **Encapsulation:** Hiding internal details via getters/setters.  
    - **Inheritance:** Reusing code by extending classes.  
    - **Polymorphism:** Method overriding and overloading.  
    - **Abstraction:** Hiding implementation using abstract classes/interfaces.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Difference between abstraction and encapsulation?">
    Abstraction hides implementation complexity.  
    Encapsulation hides internal state and controls access.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is method overloading vs overriding?">
    - **Overloading:** Same method name, different parameters (compile-time).  
    - **Overriding:** Subclass redefines parent method (runtime).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can you explain 'this' and 'super' keywords?">
    - `this` refers to current class instance.  
    - `super` refers to parent class members or constructor.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are constructors in Java?">
    Special methods invoked when objects are created. They initialize object state. Default, parameterized, and copy constructors are common types.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<hr />

## 3. Java Basics & Control Flow

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Difference between == and equals()?">
    `==` compares references (memory address).  
    `.equals()` compares object content if overridden.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is a static keyword?">
    Used for class-level variables, methods, and blocks. Shared among all instances of a class.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Difference between break and continue?">
    `break` exits a loop; `continue` skips the current iteration and continues to the next one.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is final keyword used for?">
    `final` makes variables constants, prevents method overriding, and stops class inheritance.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are varargs in Java?">
    Allows passing variable number of arguments to a method using `...`. Example: `void add(int... nums)`.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<hr />

## 4. Collections Framework

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is the Java Collections Framework?">
    A set of classes and interfaces (List, Set, Map, Queue) that store and manipulate groups of data efficiently.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Difference between ArrayList and LinkedList?">
    - **ArrayList:** Fast random access, slow insertion/deletion.  
    - **LinkedList:** Fast insertion/deletion, slow random access.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Difference between HashMap and Hashtable?">
    - **HashMap:** Not synchronized, allows null keys/values.  
    - **Hashtable:** Synchronized, legacy, doesn’t allow nulls.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Explain Set vs List vs Map">
    - **Set:** No duplicates.  
    - **List:** Ordered, allows duplicates.  
    - **Map:** Key-value pairs, no duplicate keys.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are Concurrent Collections?">
    Thread-safe collections like `ConcurrentHashMap`, `CopyOnWriteArrayList` designed for multithreaded environments.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<hr />

## 5. Exception Handling

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is exception handling?">
    Mechanism to handle runtime errors, maintaining normal application flow using `try`, `catch`, `finally`, and `throw`.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Difference between checked and unchecked exceptions?">
    **Checked:** Compile-time (e.g., IOException).  
    **Unchecked:** Runtime (e.g., NullPointerException).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is finally block used for?">
    Executes regardless of exception. Commonly used to release resources like closing files or DB connections.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Explain custom exceptions">
    Create by extending `Exception` or `RuntimeException` for domain-specific error handling.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Difference between throw and throws?">
    - `throw` is used inside methods to explicitly throw an exception.  
    - `throws` declares exceptions a method can throw.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<hr />

## 6. Multithreading & Concurrency

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is a thread in Java?">
    A thread is a lightweight subprocess that executes tasks concurrently. Created using `Thread` class or `Runnable` interface.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Explain the life cycle of a thread">
    New → Runnable → Running → Waiting/Sleeping → Terminated.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Difference between start() and run()?">
    `start()` begins a new thread; `run()` executes in the same thread like a normal method call.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is synchronization?">
    Ensures only one thread accesses a critical section at a time. Achieved using `synchronized` keyword or locks.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Explain volatile keyword">
    Ensures visibility of changes to variables across threads, preventing cached values from being used.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<hr />

## 7. Java 8 & Functional Programming

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What are lambda expressions?">
    Short syntax for anonymous functions: `(x, y) -> x + y`. Used with streams and functional interfaces.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are streams in Java 8?">
    Streams process collections functionally with map, filter, and reduce operations — enabling clean and parallelizable code.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is Optional class?">
    A container object that may or may not contain a non-null value — avoids `NullPointerException`.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are method references?">
    Shortcut for lambda expressions using `::`. Example: `System.out::println`.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Explain functional interfaces">
    Interfaces with a single abstract method (e.g., `Runnable`, `Supplier`, `Consumer`). Annotated with `@FunctionalInterface`.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<hr />

## 8. Memory Management & Garbage Collection

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How does garbage collection work?">
    JVM automatically reclaims memory of unused objects. You can suggest GC with `System.gc()`, but it’s not guaranteed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are strong, weak, and soft references?">
    - **Strong:** Prevent GC.  
    - **Weak:** Collected when weakly reachable.  
    - **Soft:** Collected only when memory is low.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are memory leaks in Java?">
    When unused objects remain referenced, preventing GC. Common in static collections or unclosed resources.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How to prevent OutOfMemoryError?">
    Optimize object creation, use streams carefully, close resources, and monitor heap usage.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Explain finalize() method">
    Called before object is garbage-collected, but it’s deprecated — prefer `try-with-resources` for cleanup.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<hr />

## 9. Spring & Framework Concepts

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is Spring Framework?">
    A Java framework providing dependency injection (IoC), AOP, and integration with databases and web apps.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Explain dependency injection (DI)">
    DI is providing dependencies from outside instead of creating them inside. Spring handles it using annotations like `@Autowired`.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is the difference between BeanFactory and ApplicationContext?">
    - **BeanFactory:** Basic container.  
    - **ApplicationContext:** Adds enterprise features like event handling and AOP.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Explain Spring Boot">
    Simplifies Spring setup with auto-configuration, embedded servers, and starter dependencies.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are common Spring annotations?">
    `@Component`, `@Service`, `@Repository`, `@Controller`, `@RestController`, `@Autowired`, `@Configuration`, `@Bean`.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
