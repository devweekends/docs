We’ll maintain a curated list here. Meanwhile, here’s how to find strong product teams:

## Discovery

- Filter LinkedIn by location=Pakistan, industry=Software, headcount 50–1,000, product keywords (SaaS, platform).
- Look for engineering blogs, public roadmaps, or open source activity.

## Apply

- Tailor to the product and users; attach a short product critique or improvement proposal.
