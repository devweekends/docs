## 1. HTML Fundamentals

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is HTML and why is it important?">
    HTML (HyperText Markup Language) structures the content of web pages using elements and tags. It defines the page layout and content hierarchy for browsers and SEO.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Explain semantic HTML">
    Semantic HTML uses meaningful tags like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>` that describe their role in the document, improving accessibility and SEO.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are meta tags?">
    Meta tags provide metadata such as page description, viewport settings, and character encoding. Example: `<meta name='viewport' content='width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0' />`.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Difference between block and inline elements?">
    Block elements (like `<div>`, `<p>`) start on new lines and take full width. Inline elements (like `<span>`, `<a>`) sit within text without breaking flow.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Explain the role of the DOCTYPE declaration">
    `<!DOCTYPE html>` tells the browser to use the HTML5 standard mode, ensuring consistent rendering across browsers.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<hr />

## 2. CSS & Styling

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is the difference between relative, absolute, and fixed positioning?">
    **Relative:** moves relative to its normal position.  
    **Absolute:** positions relative to the nearest positioned ancestor.  
    **Fixed:** sticks to viewport regardless of scrolling.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Explain Flexbox">
    Flexbox provides a one-dimensional layout system for aligning and distributing space in a container. Core properties: `display: flex`, `justify-content`, `align-items`, `flex-direction`.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Explain CSS Grid">
    Grid is two-dimensional (rows and columns). Use `display: grid` and properties like `grid-template-rows`, `grid-template-columns`, `gap`.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is specificity in CSS?">
    Determines which rule takes precedence. Order: inline styles > IDs > classes > elements. The higher specificity wins.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do you optimize CSS performance?">
    Minify CSS, use critical CSS for above-the-fold content, limit nesting, and prefer utility frameworks like Tailwind for scalability.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<hr />

## 3. JavaScript Core Concepts

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Explain hoisting in JavaScript">
    Variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution. Only declarations are hoisted, not initializations.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Difference between var, let, and const">
    `var` has function scope and can be re-declared;  
    `let` and `const` have block scope;  
    `const` cannot be reassigned after initialization.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is event delegation?">
    Attaching a single event listener to a parent element to manage events on its children using event bubbling.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Explain closures">
    A closure is a function that remembers variables from its outer scope even after that scope has returned.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Difference between synchronous and asynchronous code">
    **Synchronous:** executes line-by-line.  
    **Asynchronous:** allows tasks (like fetching data) to run in the background using Promises or async/await.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<hr />

## 4. React Fundamentals

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is React?">
    React is a declarative JavaScript library for building reusable UI components with virtual DOM and one-way data flow.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Explain virtual DOM">
    Virtual DOM is an in-memory representation of the real DOM. React compares diffs and updates only changed parts for performance.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are props and state?">
    Props are read-only data passed from parent to child; state is mutable data within a component that triggers re-render when updated.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Difference between controlled and uncontrolled components">
    Controlled components use React state to manage input values.  
    Uncontrolled components use refs to access DOM values directly.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is the purpose of keys in lists?">
    Keys help React identify which items changed, added, or removed. Always provide a unique `key` when rendering lists.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<hr />

## 5. React Hooks & Lifecycle

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Explain useEffect">
    Handles side effects such as fetching data or subscriptions. Dependency array controls re-run logic; cleanup prevents memory leaks.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is useMemo and useCallback?">
    `useMemo` memoizes computed values, `useCallback` memoizes functions. Both prevent unnecessary re-renders for performance.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How to handle forms in React?">
    Use controlled components with `onChange` and state, or libraries like Formik/React Hook Form for validation and handling.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Explain context API">
    Context allows sharing global data (like theme, user) without prop drilling, using `createContext` and `useContext`.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does React reconciliation work?">
    React compares new and old virtual DOM trees and efficiently updates only changed nodes — this is called diffing.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<hr />

## 6. Next.js & Advanced Frontend

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is Next.js?">
    Next.js is a React framework providing server-side rendering (SSR), static generation (SSG), routing, and API routes for full-stack apps.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Explain SSR, SSG, and CSR">
    **SSR:** Rendered on server for better SEO.  
    **SSG:** Pre-rendered at build time for static sites.  
    **CSR:** Fully client-rendered via React.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is dynamic routing in Next.js?">
    File-based routing using `[param].js` inside the `pages` folder. Example: `pages/users/[id].js` for dynamic user pages.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How to optimize performance in Next.js?">
    Use `next/image` for lazy loading, `getStaticProps` for pre-rendering, code-splitting, and caching via headers.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How to handle environment variables in Next.js?">
    Use `.env.local` and access via `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_...` for client-side variables.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<hr />

## 7. TypeScript in Frontend

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is TypeScript and why use it?">
    TypeScript adds static typing to JavaScript, reducing bugs, improving IDE support, and enabling better code maintainability.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Explain interfaces vs types">
    Both define shapes of objects, but `interface` supports declaration merging, while `type` can define unions and complex types.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are generics?">
    Generics create reusable components and functions that work with multiple types. Example: `function identity<T>(arg: T): T { return arg; }`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What are utility types?">
    Built-in helpers like `Partial`, `Pick`, `Omit`, `Readonly` that modify existing types dynamically.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How does TypeScript improve React development?">
    It enforces prop types, detects errors early, and improves IntelliSense. Example: `interface Props { name: string } const Hello = ({ name }: Props) => <div>{name}</div>`
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<hr />

## 8. Frontend Performance & Optimization

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How to improve frontend performance?">
    Use lazy loading, code splitting, image optimization, memoization, and caching. Minimize re-renders and reduce bundle size.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Explain lazy loading in React">
    Load components only when needed using `React.lazy()` and `Suspense`. Reduces initial load time.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is debouncing and throttling?">
    Debounce delays execution until a pause in input (e.g., search). Throttle limits execution rate of a function.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is bundle splitting?">
    Divides large JS bundles into smaller chunks loaded on demand, improving load performance and caching efficiency.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Explain image optimization techniques">
    Use WebP format, responsive images (`srcset`), and lazy loading (`loading='lazy'`). Next.js `Image` handles this automatically.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<hr />

## 9. Accessibility & Testing

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is web accessibility (a11y)?">
    Ensuring web apps are usable by everyone, including people with disabilities. Follow WCAG guidelines, use ARIA attributes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do you test React components?">
    Use Jest and React Testing Library. Test user interactions, not implementation details. Example: `screen.getByText('Submit')`.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Explain snapshot testing">
    Captures component output and compares it in future runs to detect UI changes automatically.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How to ensure accessibility in forms?">
    Add labels to inputs, use proper focus states, and provide keyboard navigation support.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What tools can you use for accessibility testing?">
    Lighthouse, axe-core, Wave, or Chrome DevTools Accessibility panel.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<hr />

## 10. Deployment & Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How to deploy React or Next.js apps?">
    Deploy via Vercel, Netlify, or AWS. Build using `npm run build`, then upload static files or SSR output.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How to secure frontend apps?">
    Use HTTPS, sanitize user input, implement CSP headers, avoid storing tokens in localStorage, prefer HttpOnly cookies.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Explain CI/CD for frontend apps">
    Automate testing and deployment using GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or Vercel pipelines for faster iteration and reliability.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How to manage environment variables securely?">
    Keep `.env` out of version control, use deployment environment configs (Vercel, Netlify secrets).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Best practices for maintainable frontend code?">
    Use consistent styling, modular components, meaningful naming, linting, and maintain clear folder structure.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
