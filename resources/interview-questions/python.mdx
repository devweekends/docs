# Python Interview Questions (50+ Detailed Q&A)

## 1. Core Language & Internals

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="1. Python Memory Management">
**Answer**:
*   **Private Heap**: Stores all objects. Management by Python Memory Manager.
*   **Reference Counting**: Main mechanism. Object deleted when Ref Count = 0.
*   **Garbage Collector**: Cyclic GC (Generational) to fix Reference Cycles (A->B->A).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="2. The GIL (Global Interpreter Lock)">
**Answer**:
Mutex protecting Python from race conditions in memory management.
**Effect**: Only one thread executes Python Bytecode at a time.
**Result**: Multithreading is not parallel for CPU tasks. Good for I/O.
**Bypass**: Use `multiprocessing` or C extensions (NumPy).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="3. Mutable vs Immutable Types">
**Answer**:
*   **Immutable**: Int, Float, String, Tuple, FrozenSet. (Modifying creates NEW object).
*   **Mutable**: List, Dict, Set, ByteArrays. (Modified in place).
**Gotcha**: Mutable default arguments in functions behave weirdly (Shared across calls).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="4. List vs Tuple">
**Answer**:
*   **List**: Mutable, slower, heavier methods. `[]`.
*   **Tuple**: Immutable, faster, hashable (can be Dict key). `()`.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="5. `__init__` vs `__new__`">
**Answer**:
*   `__new__`: Static. Creates instance. Returns it.
*   `__init__`: Instance method. Initializes attributes. Returns None.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="6. Decorators">
**Answer**:
Pattern to wrap a function to add behavior (Logging, Auth) without modifying it.
Higher-Order Function taking a func and returning a wrapper.
`@my_decorator`.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="7. Generators (`yield`)">
**Answer**:
Function returning an Iterator.
Lazy Evaluation (One item at a time). Saves Memory.
`yield` pauses execution. `next()` resumes.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="8. Context Managers (`with`)">
**Answer**:
Manage resource allocation/release (Files, Locks).
Class with `__enter__` and `__exit__`.
Ensures cleanup even on error.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="9. Metaclasses">
**Answer**:
"Class of a Class". Defines how a class is created.
Used for registering classes (ORM) or enforcing rules.
`type` is the default metaclass.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="10. Deep Copy vs Is Assignment">
**Answer**:
*   `=`: Reference copy.
*   `copy.copy()`: Shallow (Nested objects shared).
*   `copy.deepcopy()`: Recursive copy.
*   `is`: Check Identity (Memory Address).
*   `==`: Check Value Equality.
</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## 3. Asyncio & Concurrency

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="21. `async` and `await`">
**Answer**:

<Accordion title="24. Threading vs Multiprocessing">
**Answer**:
*   **Threading**: I/O bound. Shared Memory. Lightweight. GIL limits CPU.
*   **Multiprocessing**: CPU bound. Separate Memory. Heavy (Process overhead). Bypasses GIL.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="25. Race Conditions">

Use `dataclass` (3.7+) or `namedtuple` for data holders.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="49. Circular Imports">
