# REST & Microservices Interview Questions (50+ Detailed Q&A)

## 1. REST API Design

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="1. Six Constraints of REST">
**Answer**:
1.  **Client-Server**: Separation.
2.  **Stateless**: Server stores no session.
3.  **Cacheable**: Client can cache.
4.  **Uniform Interface**: Standard verbs/paths.
5.  **Layered System**: LBs/Proxies transparent.
6.  **Code on Demand**: (Optional) JS.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="2. HTTP Verbs & Idempotency">
**Answer**:
*   `GET`: Safe. Idempotent.
*   `POST`: Create. NOT Idempotent.
*   `PUT`: Replace/Update. Idempotent.
*   `PATCH`: Partial Update. NOT Idempotent (technically, depending on op).
*   `DELETE`: Remove. Idempotent.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="3. Status Codes">
**Answer**:
*   **2xx**: Success (200 OK, 201 Created, 204 No Content).
*   **3xx**: Redirection (301 Moved Perm, 304 Not Modified).
*   **4xx**: Client Error (400 Bad Req, 401 Unauth, 403 Forbidden, 404 Not Found, 429 Too Many Reqs).
*   **5xx**: Server Error (500 Internal, 502 Bad Gateway, 503 Unavailable).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="4. REST vs SOAP">
**Answer**:
*   **SOAP**: XML, Strict Contract (WSDL), Transport independent (can use SMTP), Heavy.
*   **REST**: JSON/XML, HTTP based, Lightweight, Flexible.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="5. HATEOAS">
**Answer**:
Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State.
Response contains links to next actions.
`{ "id": 1, "links": [{ "rel": "delete", "href": "/1" }] }`.
Makes API discoverable. Only Root URL needed hardcoded.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="6. Pagination Strategies">
**Answer**:
*   **Offset/Limit**: `skip=10&limit=10`. Slow on deep pages (DB scans skipped rows).
*   **Cursor**: `after=cursor_id`. Fast. No total count.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="7. Versioning Strategies">
**Answer**:
*   **URI Path**: `/v1/users` (Most common).
*   **Query Param**: `?v=1`.
*   **Header**: `Accept-Version: v1`.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="8. Content Negotiation">
**Answer**:
Client sends `Accept: application/json`.
Server returns JSON.
If `Accept: application/xml`, server tries XML. Returns 406 Not Acceptable if unsupported.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="9. Patch vs Put">
**Answer**:
*   `PUT /users/1`: Requires sending FULL object. Replaces entire resource.
*   `PATCH /users/1`: Send only `{ "email": "new" }`. Merges.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="10. Handling Long Running Operations">
**Answer**:
Return `202 Accepted` immediately.
Include `Location: /tasks/123`.
Client polls `/tasks/123` until status is "Completed".
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 2. Microservices Architecture

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="11. Monolith vs Microservices">
**Answer**:
*   **Monolith**: Single codebase/deploy. Simple. Scales vertically or cloning. High coupling.
*   **Microservices**: Independent services. Complex ops. Independent scaling/deploy. Loose coupling.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="12. Database per Service">
**Answer**:
Anti-pattern to share DB.
Each service owns its data. Others access via API.
Ensures Loose Coupling.
Challenges: Distributed Transactions, Joint Reporting.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="13. API Gateway pattern">
**Answer**:
Single Entry Point.
Handles: Auth, Rate Limiting, Routing, SSL Termination, Request aggregation.
Tools: Kong, Apigee, AWS API Gateway.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="14. Service Registry & Discovery">
**Answer**:
Services fetch dynamic IP of peers.
*   **Client-side**: Client queries Registry (Consul/Eureka).
*   **Server-side**: Client calls LB. LB queries Registry. K8s DNS is Server-side.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="15. Sags Pattern (Distributed Transactions)">
**Answer**:
Sequence of local transactions.
If step 3 fails, execute **Compensating Transactions** (Undo) for step 2 and 1 in reverse.
*   **Choreography**: Event based.
*   **Orchestration**: Central coordinator.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="16. CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)">
**Answer**:
Split Write Model (Command) and Read Model (Query).
Write to Normalized DB. Sync to Denormalized Read DB (Elasticsearch).
Scale Reads independently.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="17. Event Sourcing">
**Answer**:
Store State as sequence of Events (`UserCreated`, `NameChanged`).
Replay events to restore state.
Audit trail built-in.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="18. Circuit Breaker">
**Answer**:
Wrap external calls. If failures > threshold, trip breaker.
Return fallback response / error immediately.
Prevent cascading failure.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="19. Strangler Fig Pattern">
**Answer**:
Migrating Monolith to Microservices.
Put Gateway in front.
Route new functionality to new Service.
Gradually extract pieces until Monolith dies.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="20. Bulkhead Pattern">
**Answer**:
Isolate resources (Thread pools).
If Service A hangs, it consumes its own pool, leaving Service B pool free.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 3. Communication Protocols

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="21. gRPC vs REST">
**Answer**:
*   **gRPC**: HTTP/2. Protobuf (Binary). Bidirectional streaming. Strict schema. Fast (Internal).

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="22. GraphQL vs REST">
