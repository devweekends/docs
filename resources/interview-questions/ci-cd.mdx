# CI/CD Interview Questions (50+ Detailed Q&A)

## 1. Concepts & Pipelines

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="1. CI vs CD vs CD">
**Answer**:
*   **CI (Integration)**: Merge code often -> Build -> Test. Detect bugs early.
*   **CD (Delivery)**: Code is ready to deploy. Artifact created. Manual approval to Prod.
*   **CD (Deployment)**: Zero touch. Pass test -> Auto Deploy to Prod.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="2. Idempotency in DevOps">
**Answer**:
Running a script twice produces the same result.
Example: `mkdir flow` fails 2nd time. `mkdir -p` is idempotent.
Ansible/Terraform are idempotent.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="3. Pipeline Stages">
**Answer**:
Checkout -> Lint -> Compile/Build -> Unit Test -> SAST -> Package (Docker) -> Publish Artifact -> Deploy Dev -> Integration Test -> Deploy Staging -> E2E Test -> Deploy Prod.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="4. Mutable vs Immutable Infrastructure">
**Answer**:
*   **Mutable**: SSH into server, `apt-get update`. Drift happens. Hard to reproduce.
*   **Immutable**: Build new Image/VM. Replace old one. Consistent. Rollback easy.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="5. Configuration Management vs Provisioning">
**Answer**:
*   **Provisioning**: Create Infra (Terraform, CloudFormation).
*   **Config Mgmt**: Configure OS/Software (Ansible, Chef, Puppet).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="6. Monorepo vs Polyrepo CI">
**Answer**:
*   **Monorepo**: Smart change detection needed (Did `/lib` change? Build all dependents). Shared tooling.
*   **Polyrepo**: Simple. Repo change = Pipeline run. Dependency hell.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="7. Artifact Management">
**Answer**:
Store binaries (Jar, Docker Image).
Nexus, Artifactory, Container Registry.
Versioned, Immutable.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="8. Self-hosted vs SaaS Runners">
**Answer**:
*   **SaaS (GitHub Actions)**: Easy. Pay/min. Security risk (Shared environment).
*   **Self-hosted**: Control hardware, Network access (VPC), Cheaper at scale. Maintenance overhead.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="9. Pipeline as Code">
**Answer**:
Defining workflow in YAML/Groovy (`Jenkinsfile`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`) stored in Git.
Version controlled, Peer reviewed.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="10. Fan-out / Parallelism">
**Answer**:
Splitting tests (Unit, Integration, Lint) to run concurrently to reduce pipeline time.
Matrix builds (Node 14, 16, 18).
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 2. Testing Strategies

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="11. The Testing Pyramid">
**Answer**:
Shape: Pyramid.
*   **Base**: Unit (70%). Fast, Cheap.
*   **Middle**: Integration (20%).
*   **Top**: E2E (10%). Slow, Flaky.
If Inverted (Pizza/IceCream Cone): Anti-pattern. Slow feedback loop.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="12. Unit vs Integration vs E2E">
**Answer**:
*   **Unit**: Single function/class. Mock everything.
*   **Integration**: Interaction (Service + DB).
*   **E2E**: Full user journey (Selenium/Cypress). Real browser.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="13. Smoke Testing / Sanity Testing">
**Answer**:
*   **Smoke**: "Is it on fire?". Basic check (Can I login?). Run after deployment.
*   **Sanity**: Check specific new functionality.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="14. Code Coverage">
**Answer**:
% of code executed during tests.
Metric, not goal. 100% coverage doesn't mean bug free.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="15. Static Analysis (Linting)">
**Answer**:
Check code without running it. Formatting, Syntax, Potential bugs.
ESLint, SonarQube.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="16. Shift Left Testing">
**Answer**:
Testing early in the lifecycle (Dev machine, pre-commit) rather than waiting for QA phase.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="17. Flaky Tests">
**Answer**:
Passes sometimes, fails others (Timing, Network).
**Fix**: Retries, Isolate environment, remove sleep() use waitFor().
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="18. Contract Testing (Pact)">
**Answer**:
For Microservices.
Ensures Consumer and Provider agree on API schema.
Prevents breaking changes.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="19. Performance Testing">
**Answer**:
*   **Load**: Normal expected load.
*   **Stress**: Breaking point.
*   **Soak**: Long duration (Memory leaks).
*   **Spike**: Sudden burst.
Tool: JMeter, K6.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="20. Test Data Management">
**Answer**:
Don't use Prod data (Privacy).
Synthetic data or Anonymized dump.
Reset after test.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 3. Deployment Patterns

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="21. Blue Green Deployment">
**Answer**:
PROD (Blue). Deploy to Idle (Green).
Test Green.
Switch Load Balancer -> Green.
Rollback: Switch back.
Cost: Double resource usage.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="22. Canary Deployment">
**Answer**:
Deploy to small % (5%).
Monitor metrics (Errors, Latency).
Gradually increase (10%, 50%, 100%).
Limits blast radius.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="23. Rolling Update">
**Answer**:
Replace instances one by one (or batch).
Zero downtime.
Risk: Version compatibility (Running v1 and v2 same time).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="24. Feature Toggles (Flags)">
**Answer**:
Deploy code to prod but keep it hidden behind `if (flag)`.
Decouples Deployment (Binary move) from Release (Feature visibility).
A/B Testing.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="25. Shadow Deployment (Dark Launch)">
**Answer**:
Traffic copy (Mirroring).
Send Request to v1 and v2. Return v1 result. Compare v2 result async.
Test accuracy/performance without user impact.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="26. GitOps (ArgoCD)">
**Answer**:
Git is Truth.
Cluster Agent (Argo) pulls state from Git -> Applies to K8s.
Detects Drift (Manual changes reverted).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="27. Recreate Strategy">
**Answer**:
Down all old. Up all new.
Downtime exists.
Needed if Schema change is backward incompatible or Singleton app.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="28. Rollback Strategy">
**Answer**:
Auto-rollback on health check failure.
Versioned artifacts essential.
Database rollback is the hard part (Backward compatible schema changes).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="29. A/B Testing">
**Answer**:
Experiment. Group A sees feature X, Group B sees Y. Measure conversion.
Business decision, not just technical.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="30. Environment Promotion">
**Answer**:
Artifact built ONCE.
Promoted `Dev -> QA -> Prod`.
Configuration injected per env (Env vars).
Never rebuild for Prod (Risk different code).
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 4. Security (DevSecOps)

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="31. SAST vs DAST">
**Answer**:
*   **SAST**: Static. Source Code scan. (Whitebox). Find SQLi pattern.
*   **DAST**: Dynamic. Running App scan. (Blackbox). Attack running endpoint.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="32. Dependency Scanning (SCA)">
**Answer**:
Software Composition Analysis.
Check `package.json` against CVE database (Snyk, Dependabot).
Find vulnerable libraries.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="33. Container Scanning">
**Answer**:
Scan Docker layers for OS vulnerabilities (Trivy, Clair).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="34. Secrets Management in CI">
**Answer**:
Never commit output.
Use GH Secrets / Vault.
Mask secrets in logs.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="35. Least Privilege">
**Answer**:
CI Runner should have minimal IAM permissions.
Don't give Admin.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="36. Signed Commits">
**Answer**:
GPG signing. Verify author identity.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="37. Supply Chain Attack">
**Answer**:
Attacker compromises a dependency (npm pip) or build tool (SolarWinds).
Mitigation: Lockfiles, Vendor dependencies, SLSA.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="38. Image Signing">
**Answer**:
Notary / Cosign.
Ensures image running in Prod is the one built by CI.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="39. Compliance as Code">
**Answer**:
OPA (Open Policy Agent).
Ensure Infra meets rules (No public Buckets) in pipeline.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="40. Hardening CI Environment">
**Answer**:
Ephemeral runners (clean slate).
Network isolation.
Audit logs.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 5. Tools & Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="41. Docker in Docker (DinD)">
**Answer**:
Running Docker commands inside a Docker container (Agent).
Needs Privileged mode (Security risk) or Socket binding.
Kaniko builds images without Daemon.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="42. Jenkins vs GitHub Actions">
**Answer**:
*   **Jenkins**: Old, Powerful, Plugin hell, Self-hosted maintenance.
*   **GHA**: YAML, Integrated, Marketplace, SaaS.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="43. Build Caching">
**Answer**:
