# Mercor Interview Preparation Guide

This guide is specifically curated for **Software Engineer / Developer** positions at Mercor. It covers multi-disciplinary topics including database design, system architecture, and behavioral decision-making.

## 1. Database Design & Architecture

### Core Design Principles
When designing database architecture for user flows, consider:
1.  **Data Flow Mapping**: Map user actions to CRUD operations and plan transaction boundaries.
2.  **Schema Design**: Normalize data to reduce redundancy and design efficient indexes.
3.  **Scalability**: Choose between read-replicas, sharding, or microservices patterns.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Q: How do you handle database scaling?">
**Answer Framework**:
- **Vertical Scaling**: Increase CPU/RAM (simple but limited).
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Add more servers (Scalable but complex).
- **Read Replicas**: Distribute SELECT queries to slaves.
- **Sharding**: Horizontally partition data across multiple database instances.
- **Caching**: Use Redis to store hot query results.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Q: Explain ACID properties">
**Answer**:
- **Atomicity**: "All or nothing" - transaction fails if any part fails.
- **Consistency**: Database follows rules (constraints) before and after.
- **Isolation**: Concurrent transactions don't interfere.
- **Durability**: Committed data survives power loss/system crash.
</Accordion>

## 2. System Design: Load Balancing

Load balancing distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to prevent bottlenecks.

### Algorithms
- **Round Robin**: Sequential distribution.
- **Weighted Round Robin**: Routes more traffic to powerful servers.
- **Least Connections**: Best for long-lived connections (routes to least busy server).
- **IP Hash**: Ensures a user stays on the same server (sticky sessions).

### Technical Implementation (Node.js)
Using the built-in `cluster` module to utilize all CPU cores:

```javascript
const cluster = require('cluster');
const numCPUs = require('os').cpus().length;
const express = require('express');

if (cluster.isMaster) {
    for (let i = 0; i < numCPUs; i++) cluster.fork();
    
    cluster.on('exit', (worker) => {
        console.log(`Worker ${worker.process.pid} died. Respawning...`);
        cluster.fork();
    });
} else {
    const app = express();
    app.get('/', (req, res) => res.send(`Handled by worker ${process.pid}`));
    app.listen(3000);
}
```

## 3. Caching & Streaming

### Caching Patterns
1.  **Cache-Aside**: App checks cache; if miss, reads DB and updates cache.
2.  **Write-Through**: App writes to cache and DB simultaneously.
3.  **Write-Behind**: App writes to cache immediately; DB is updated asynchronously later.

### Real-time Communication
- **WebSockets**: Full-duplex interactive communication (Best for chat).
- **SSE (Server-Sent Events)**: Uni-directional stream from server to client (Best for dashboards/news).
- **Long Polling**: Legacy method where client holds connection until server has data.

## 4. Behavioral & Decision-Making (Scenario-Based)

Mercor frequently uses **Option A vs Option B** scenarios to test engineering trade-offs.

### Scenario 1: Critical Deadline
**Problem**: Deadline is tomorrow, but feature isn't ready.
- **Option A**: Add more developers immediately.
- **Option B**: Ask current team to work overtime.

**Analysis**:
- **Option A (The Trap)**: Brooks' Law - "Adding people to a late project makes it later" due to onboarding overhead.
- **Choice**: **Option B** is often safer for a 24-hour deadline, but **Option A** is better for a 2-week delay. Justify based on the **Time Horizon**.

### Scenario 2: Security vs Feature Launch
**Problem**: You found a vulnerability just before launch.
- **Option A**: Delay launch and fix security.
- **Option B**: Launch now, fix in next sprint.

**Choice**: **Option A**. Repercussions of a breach (legal, reputational) far outweigh the loss of a feature launch date.

## 5. Technical Deep Dives (Sample Questions)

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Q: Design a URL Shortener (Bit.ly)">
**Answer**:
1.  **Logic**: Map unique IDs (base62) to long URLs.
2.  **Storage**: NoSQL (Key-Value) or SQL with Index on the "short_code".
3.  **Scale**: Use **Redis** for the most accessed URLs (10% of links get 90% of traffic).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Q: Design a Social Media Relationship Feed">
**Answer**:
- Use a **Relationships Table** (follower_id, following_id).
- For the feed: `SELECT * FROM posts WHERE user_id IN (SELECT following_id FROM relationships WHERE follower_id = ?)`.
- **Optimization**: For celebs, use **Push Model** (precompute feed); for regular users, use **Pull Model**.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Q: Implement a Health Check System">
**Answer**:
Load balancers check `/health` endpoints. If server returns `50x` or times out, it is removed from the rotation.

```javascript
async function healthCheck(server) {
    try {
        const res = await fetch(`${server.url}/health`);
        server.healthy = res.ok;
    } catch {
        server.healthy = false;
    }
}
```
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 6. Preparation Checklist
- [ ] **STAR Method**: Practice Situation, Task, Action, Result for behavioral answers.
- [ ] **Trade-offs**: Always mention "Pros and Cons" before picking an Option (A or B).
- [ ] **Coding**: Be ready to explain `Express` middleware, `Redis` integration, and `SQL` indexing.
- [ ] **Infrastructure**: Understand Layer 4 vs Layer 7 load balancing.
