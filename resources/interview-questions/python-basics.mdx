# Python Interview Questions (Fundamentals)

A comprehensive guide to Python interview questions, organized by category. This collection covers fundamental syntax to advanced concepts for the 2025 edition.

## 1. Python Basics
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="1. What is Python and what are its key features?">
**Answer**:
Python is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose programming language created by Guido van Rossum in 1991.

**Key Features:**
- **Easy to Learn/Read**: Simple syntax that resembles English.
- **Interpreted**: Code is executed line-by-line, no separate compilation needed.
- **Dynamically Typed**: Variable types are determined at runtime.
- **Object-Oriented**: Supports classes and object encapsulation.
- **Extensive Libraries**: Massive standard library for almost any task.
- **Cross-platform**: Runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="2. What are Python's built-in data types?">
**Answer**:
Python provides several built-in types to handle different data structures:

| Category | Types |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Numeric** | `int`, `float`, `complex` |
| **Sequence** | `list`, `tuple`, `range`, `str` |
| **Mapping** | `dict` |
| **Set** | `set`, `frozenset` |
| **Boolean** | `bool` |
| **None Type** | `NoneType` |
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="3. What is the difference between lists and tuples?">
**Answer**:

| Feature | Lists | Tuples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mutability** | Mutable (can change) | Immutable (cannot change) |
| **Syntax** | Square brackets `[]` | Parentheses `()` |
| **Performance** | Slower | Faster |
| **Methods** | Many built-in methods | Fewer methods |
| **Use Case** | Frequent modifications | Fixed data / Constants |
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="4. Explain Python's mutable and immutable types.">
**Answer**:
- **Mutable**: Objects that can be modified after creation.
  - Examples: `list`, `dict`, `set`, and custom class objects.
  - Example: `l = [1]; l[0] = 2` (Works)
- **Immutable**: Objects that cannot be changed once created. Any modification creates a new object.
  - Examples: `int`, `float`, `str`, `tuple`, `frozenset`.
  - Example: `s = 'hi'; s[0] = 'H'` (Raises `TypeError`)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="5. Identity Operators: 'is' vs 'is not'">
**Answer**:
Identify operators check if two variables reference the **same object in memory**, not just if they have the same value.

```python
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a
c = [1, 2, 3]

print(a is b)      # True (same reference)
print(a is c)      # False (different reference, even if values match)
print(a == c)      # True (values are equal)
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="6. Python Naming Conventions (PEP 8)">
**Answer**:
- **Variables/Functions**: `snake_case` (e.g., `calculate_sum`).
- **Classes**: `PascalCase` (e.g., `MyClass`).
- **Constants**: `UPPER_CASE` (e.g., `MAX_RETRIES`).
- **Private Variables**: Single underscore prefix (`_private`).
- **Avoid**: Single letters except for loops (`i, j, k`).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="7. Equality (==) vs Identity (is) operators">
**Answer**:
- `==` checks for **Equality** (Do they have the same value?).
- `is` checks for **Identity** (Do they point to the exact same memory address?).

```python
x = [1, 2]
y = [1, 2]
print(x == y) # True
print(x is y) # False
```
*Note: Commonly used with `None` checks: `if val is None:`.*
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="8. Membership Operators: 'in' vs 'not in'">
**Answer**:
Used to test if a sequence (string, list, tuple, etc.) contains a specific value.

```python
'a' in 'apple'         # True
5 in [1, 2, 3]         # False
'key' in {'key': 1}    # True (checks dictionary keys)
```
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 2. Data Structures
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="9. List Manipulation Methods">
**Answer**:
Common operations for `list`:
- `append(x)`: Adds `x` to the end.
- `insert(i, x)`: Inserts `x` at index `i`.
- `remove(x)`: Removes the first occurrence of `x`.
- `pop()`: Removes and returns the last element.
- `extend(iter)`: Adds all elements from an iterable.
- `sort()`: Sorts the list in place.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="10. List Comprehensions">
**Answer**:
A concise way to create lists.
**Syntax**: `[expression for item in iterable if condition]`

```python
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
evens = [x for x in range(20) if x % 2 == 0]
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="11. Dictionaries and Key Methods">
**Answer**:
Unordered collections of key-value pairs. Keys must be **immutable**.
- `get(key, default)`: Safely access values without raising errors.
- `keys()` / `values()` / `items()`: Views of the dictionary components.
- `update(other_dict)`: Merge another dictionary into the current one.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="12. Sets vs Frozensets">
**Answer**:
- **Set**: Mutable, unordered collection of unique elements. Supports `add()` and `remove()`.
- **Frozenset**: Immutable version of a set. Can be used as a dictionary key or an element of another set.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="13. Set Operations">
**Answer**:
| Operation | Operator | Method |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Union** | `|` | `set1.union(set2)` |
| **Intersection**| `&` | `set1.intersection(set2)` |
| **Difference** | `-` | `set1.difference(set2)` |
| **Sym. Diff** | `^` | `set1.symmetric_difference(set2)` |
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="14. Sequence Operations (Slicing/Indexing)">
**Answer**:
Work on strings, lists, and tuples:
- `text[0]`: Access first element.
- `text[1:4]`: Slice from index 1 to 3.
- `text[::-1]`: Reverse the sequence.
- `len(text)`: Get length.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="15. How do you sort a list of dictionaries?">
**Answer**:
Use the `sorted()` function with a `lambda` as the `key` parameter.

```python
students = [{'name': 'John', 'age': 25}, {'name': 'Jane', 'age': 22}]
# Sort by age
sorted_list = sorted(students, key=lambda x: x['age'])
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="16. Deep Copy vs Shallow Copy">
**Answer**:
- **Shallow Copy**: Creates a new container, but elements inside still refer to the original objects.
- **Deep Copy**: Creates a new container and recursively copies every object inside it (completely independent).

```python
import copy
shallow = copy.copy(original)
deep = copy.deepcopy(original)
```
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 3. Object-Oriented Programming
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="17. Four Pillars of OOP">
**Answer**:
1. **Encapsulation**: Bundling data and methods, hiding internal state.
2. **Abstraction**: Hiding complexity and showing only necessary features.
3. **Inheritance**: Creating new classes based on existing ones.
4. **Polymorphism**: Ability for different objects to respond to the same method call differently.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="18. Creating a Class and __init__">
**Answer**:
```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name  # Instance attribute
        self.age = age

    def greet(self):
        return f"Hi, I'm {self.name}"

p1 = Person("Adam", 30)
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="19. Instance vs Class vs Static Methods">
**Answer**:
- **Instance**: Accesses `self`. Standard method.
- **Class**: Accesses `cls`. Decorated with `@classmethod`. Operates on class state.
- **Static**: No access to `self` or `cls`. Decorated with `@staticmethod`. Just a utility function.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="20. Inheritance and super()">
**Answer**:
Inheritance allows code reuse. `super()` is used to call methods (usually the constructor) from the parent class.

```python
class Animal:
    def speak(self): return "Mute"

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self): return "Woof"
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="21. Magic Methods (Dunder Methods)">
**Answer**:
Special methods starting and ending with `__`.
- `__init__`: Constructor.
- `__str__`: Human-readable string representation.
- `__repr__`: Detailed developers representation.
- `__len__`: Custom length logic.
- `__add__`: Operator overloading for `+`.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="22. Property Decorators (@property)">
**Answer**:
Allows methods to be accessed like attributes while providing "Getter" and "Setter" logic.

```python
class User:
    def __init__(self, age): self._age = age
    
    @property
    def age(self): return self._age
    
    @age.setter
    def age(self, value):
        if value < 0: raise ValueError("Age can't be negative")
        self._age = value
```
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 4. Functions and Decorators
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="25. What are *args and **kwargs?">
**Answer**:
- `*args`: Accepts a variable number of positional arguments (as a tuple).
- `**kwargs`: Accepts a variable number of keyword arguments (as a dictionary).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="26. Lambda Functions">
**Answer**:
Small anonymous functions. Limited to a single expression.
`square = lambda x: x * x`
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="27. What are Decorators?">
**Answer**:
Functions that wrap another function to modify its behavior without changing its source code.

```python
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Before")
        func()
        print("After")
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def say_hi(): print("Hi")
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="28. Closures">
**Answer**:
A function that "remembers" variables from its enclosing scope even after the outer function has finished execution.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="31. Generators and yield">
**Answer**:
Generators produce values one at a time using `yield`. They are memory efficient because they don't store the whole sequence in RAM.

```python
def count_to_three():
    yield 1
    yield 2
    yield 3
```
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 5. File Handling and I/O
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="33. How do you read and write files?">
**Answer**:
Always use the `with` statement (context manager) to ensure files are closed properly.

```python
# Reading
with open('file.txt', 'r') as f:
    content = f.read()

# Writing ('w' overwrites, 'a' appends)
with open('file.txt', 'w') as f:
    f.write("Hello")
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="36. Working with JSON">
**Answer**:
```python
import json
data = {"id": 1}
string = json.dumps(data)  # To String
obj = json.loads(string)   # From String
```
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 6. Exception Handling
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="39. try-except Blocks">
**Answer**:
Used to handle errors gracefully.
```python
try:
    x = 1 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero")
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="41. try-except-else-finally">
**Answer**:
- `else`: Runs if NO exception occurred.
- `finally`: ALWAYS runs (cleanup code).
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 8. Advanced Concepts
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="51. Iterators vs Iterables">
**Answer**:
- **Iterable**: Any object you can loop over (List, Tuple). Implements `__iter__`.
- **Iterator**: The actual object that tracks state during iteration. Implements `__next__`.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="52. Multithreading vs Multiprocessing">
**Answer**:
- **Multithreading**: Shares memory. Best for I/O-bound tasks. Subject to the GIL.
- **Multiprocessing**: Separate memory space. Best for CPU-bound tasks. True parallelism.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="53. Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)">
**Answer**:
A mutex that allows only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time. It prevents race conditions in memory management but limits CPU-bound multithreaded performance.
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 10. Data Science & Numerical Python
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="65. What is NumPy?">
**Answer**:
A library for high-performance numerical computing. It provides `ndarray`, which is faster and more memory-efficient than Python lists for mathematical operations.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="66. What is Pandas?">
**Answer**:
A library for data manipulation and analysis. Key structures are `Series` (1D) and `DataFrame` (2D table).
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Additional Important Topics
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="76. enumerate() vs zip()">
**Answer**:
- `enumerate(iterable)`: Adds a counter (index) to an iterable.
- `zip(*iterables)`: Aggregates elements from multiple iterables into tuples.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="86. range() function">
**Answer**:
Generates a sequence of numbers. In Python 3, it's a "range object" (lazy), not a static list, making it memory efficient.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="100. PEP 8">
**Answer**:
The official style guide for Python code. Key rules:
- Use 4 spaces for indentation.
- Limit lines to 79 characters.
- Use blank lines to separate functions/classes.
- Imports should be at the top.
