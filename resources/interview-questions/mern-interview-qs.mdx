# MERN Stack Interview Questions (50+ Detailed Q&A)

## 1. MongoDB & Database Design

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="1. Relational vs Non-Relational (Why Mongo?)">
**Answer**:
Mongo (NoSQL) allows flexible Schema (JSON).
Good for: Rapid prototyping, Unstructured data, High Write Load.
Bad for: Complex Transactions, Multi-table Joins (ACID strictly needed).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="2. Modeling Relationships (Embed vs Reference)">
**Answer**:
*   **Embed**: 1-to-Few (Comments in Post). Fast read. Document size limit (16MB).
*   **Reference**: 1-to-Many (Posts by User). Normalized. Requires `$lookup` (Join).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="3. Indexing in MongoDB">
**Answer**:
B-Tree structure.
Types: Single Field, Compound, Multikey (Array), Text, Geospatial.
`explain('executionStats')` to verify Index Scan (IXSCAN).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="4. Aggregation Pipeline">
**Answer**:
Framework for data processing.
Stages: `$match` -> `$group` -> `$project` -> `$sort` -> `$limit`.
