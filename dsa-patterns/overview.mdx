## Why Learn by Patterns?

Most coding interviews test the same **22 core patterns** repeatedly. Instead of solving 1000+ random problems, understanding these patterns helps you:

- **Recognize** problem types instantly
- **Apply** proven templates to new problems
- **Optimize** solutions systematically
- **Explain** your thought process clearly

## Learning Path

<Steps>
  <Step title="Foundation (Week 1-2)">
    Start with **Two Pointers**, **Sliding Window**, and **HashMap** patterns. These appear in 40% of interview questions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Core Patterns (Week 3-4)">
    Master **Binary Search**, **DFS/BFS**, and **Stack/Queue** patterns. Build intuition for when to apply each.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Intermediate (Week 5-6)">
    Tackle **Dynamic Programming**, **Backtracking**, and **Greedy** approaches. Focus on state definition.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Advanced (Week 7-8)">
    Learn **Trie**, **Union Find**, **Monotonic Stack**, and **Bit Manipulation** for specialized problems.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Pattern Difficulty Matrix

| Pattern | Difficulty | Frequency | Time to Learn |
|---------|------------|-----------|---------------|
| Two Pointers | Easy | Very High | 2-3 days |
| Sliding Window | Easy | Very High | 2-3 days |
| HashMap | Easy | Very High | 1-2 days |
| Binary Search | Medium | Very High | 3-4 days |
| DFS/BFS | Medium | High | 4-5 days |
| Stack/Queue | Easy | High | 2-3 days |
| Heap | Medium | Medium | 3-4 days |
| Dynamic Programming | Hard | Very High | 2-3 weeks |
| Backtracking | Medium | Medium | 4-5 days |
| Greedy | Medium | Medium | 3-4 days |
| Trie | Medium | Low | 2-3 days |
| Union Find | Medium | Medium | 3-4 days |
| Monotonic Stack | Hard | Low | 3-4 days |
| Bit Manipulation | Medium | Low | 2-3 days |

<Tip>
**Pro Tip**: Focus on understanding the **why** behind each pattern, not just the **how**. This helps you adapt patterns to novel problems.
