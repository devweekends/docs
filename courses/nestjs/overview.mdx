## Learning Path

<Tip>
**Recommended Learning Order**: Follow the chapters sequentially. Each chapter builds on concepts from previous ones. Complete the hands-on exercises in each chapter before moving forward.
</Tip>

### Beginner Path (Weeks 1-4)
- Fundamentals → Dependency Injection → Controllers & Routing → Providers & Services

### Intermediate Path (Weeks 5-7)
- Database Integration → Authentication & Authorization → Testing

### Advanced Path (Weeks 8-12)
- Microservices → Deployment & Production → Advanced Patterns

## Real-World Projects

Throughout this course, you'll build:

1. **E-Commerce API** - Complete REST API with authentication, product management, and order processing
2. **Social Media Backend** - Real-time features with WebSockets, GraphQL, and microservices
3. **Task Management System** - CQRS implementation with event sourcing and advanced patterns
