# CRUD: Delete

Delete operations permanently remove documents from a collection. While deleting data seems straightforward, it's one of the most critical operations to handle carefully—**deleted data cannot be recovered** without a backup.

## Why Deletion Requires Care

### The Problem with Hard Deletes

When you delete a document in MongoDB, it's gone immediately. This can cause issues:

- **No undo option**: Accidental deletions can't be reversed
- **Broken references**: Other documents may reference the deleted document
- **Lost history**: You lose valuable data for analytics or auditing
- **Cascade effects**: Related data may become orphaned

### Soft Deletes: A Safer Alternative

Many production applications use **soft deletes** instead—marking documents as deleted without actually removing them:

```javascript
// Soft delete: mark as deleted instead of removing
db.users.updateOne(
  { _id: userId },
  { 
    $set: { 
      isDeleted: true, 
      deletedAt: new Date() 
    } 
  }
)

// Query only active documents
db.users.find({ isDeleted: { $ne: true } })
```

This approach preserves data integrity while allowing "deleted" items to be filtered out of normal queries.

<Warning>
Always ensure you have proper backups before running delete operations, especially `deleteMany()` with broad filters.
</Warning>

## Hard Delete Operations

When you genuinely need to remove data (e.g., GDPR compliance, storage optimization), MongoDB provides these methods:

## `deleteOne()`

Removes the **first** document that matches the filter.

```javascript
db.users.deleteOne({ name: "Alice" })
```

## `deleteMany()`

Removes **all** documents that match the filter.

```javascript
db.users.deleteMany({ status: "inactive" })
```

## Removing All Documents

To remove all documents from a collection but keep the collection itself (and its indexes):

```javascript
db.users.deleteMany({})
```

To remove the collection entirely (more efficient if you want to delete everything):

```javascript
db.users.drop()
```

## Summary

- Use `deleteOne()` to remove a single document.
- Use `deleteMany()` to remove multiple documents.
- Be careful! Deleted data cannot be easily recovered without a backup.
