# CRUD: Delete

Delete operations remove documents from a collection.

## `deleteOne()`

Removes the **first** document that matches the filter.

```javascript
db.users.deleteOne({ name: "Alice" })
```

## `deleteMany()`

Removes **all** documents that match the filter.

```javascript
db.users.deleteMany({ status: "inactive" })
```

## Removing All Documents

To remove all documents from a collection but keep the collection itself (and its indexes):

```javascript
db.users.deleteMany({})
```

To remove the collection entirely (more efficient if you want to delete everything):

```javascript
db.users.drop()
```

## Summary

- Use `deleteOne()` to remove a single document.
- Use `deleteMany()` to remove multiple documents.
- Be careful! Deleted data cannot be easily recovered without a backup.
