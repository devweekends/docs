# Introduction to NoSQL & MongoDB

## What is NoSQL?

**NoSQL** (Not Only SQL) databases are non-tabular databases and store data differently than relational tables. NoSQL databases come in a variety of types based on their data model. The main types are document, key-value, wide-column, and graph.

### SQL vs NoSQL

| Feature | SQL (Relational) | NoSQL (Non-Relational) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Structure** | Tables with fixed rows and columns | Document: JSON documents, Key-value: key-value pairs, etc. |
| **Schema** | Rigid | Flexible |
| **Scalability** | Vertical (scale up with a larger server) | Horizontal (scale out across commodity servers) |
| **Joins** | Complex joins supported | Joins typically handled in code or not supported |

## What is MongoDB?

**MongoDB** is a source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas.

### Key Features

1.  **Document Model**: Data is stored in documents (BSON format) grouped into collections. This maps naturally to objects in application code.
2.  **Flexible Schema**: Documents in the same collection do not need to have the same set of fields or structure.
3.  **High Availability**: Replica sets provide automatic failover and data redundancy.
4.  **Horizontal Scalability**: Sharding distributes data across a cluster of machines.
5.  **Rich Queries**: Supports ad-hoc queries, indexing, and real-time aggregation.

## JSON vs BSON

MongoDB stores data in **BSON** (Binary JSON). BSON extends the JSON model to provide additional data types, ordered fields, and to be efficient for encoding and decoding within different languages.

- **JSON**: Text-based, human-readable.
- **BSON**: Binary-encoded, supports types like Date, ObjectId, and Binary data.

## Summary

- **NoSQL** databases offer flexibility and scalability compared to traditional SQL databases.
- **MongoDB** is a document database that stores data in **BSON** format.
- It is designed for modern application development with a flexible schema and powerful query capabilities.
