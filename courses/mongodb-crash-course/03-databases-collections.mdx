# Databases & Collections

In MongoDB, data is organized in a hierarchy:
1.  **Database**: Container for collections.
2.  **Collection**: Container for documents (analogous to a Table in SQL).
3.  **Document**: The actual data record (analogous to a Row in SQL).

## Creating a Database

In MongoDB, you don't explicitly "create" a database. You just switch to a non-existent database and insert data, and it will be created automatically.

Using `mongosh` (MongoDB Shell):

```javascript
use myNewDatabase
```

## Creating a Collection

Similarly, collections are created when you first insert data into them.

```javascript
db.myCollection.insertOne({ x: 1 })
```

You can also explicitly create a collection if you need to set specific options (like validation rules or capped collections).

```javascript
db.createCollection("users")
```

## Dropping

### Drop Database

```javascript
use myDatabase
db.dropDatabase()
```

### Drop Collection

```javascript
db.myCollection.drop()
```

## Document Structure

Documents are BSON objects.

```javascript
{
  "_id": ObjectId("507f1f77bcf86cd799439011"),
  "name": "Alice",
  "age": 25,
  "address": {
    "street": "123 Main St",
    "city": "Wonderland"
  },
  "hobbies": ["reading", "coding"]
}
```

### The `_id` Field

Every document **must** have a unique `_id` field.
- If you don't provide one, MongoDB generates a unique `ObjectId` automatically.
- It is the primary key for the document.
- It is immutable (cannot be changed).

## Summary

- **Databases** hold collections.
- **Collections** hold documents.
- **Documents** are the data records (JSON/BSON).
- Databases and collections are **created lazily** (when data is inserted).
- Every document has a unique **`_id`**.
