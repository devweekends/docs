# CRUD: Create

CRUD stands for **Create, Read, Update, Delete**—the four fundamental operations for working with data in any database. In this chapter, we focus on **Create**: adding new documents to your MongoDB collections.

## Understanding Document Insertion

Unlike relational databases where you must define a table schema before inserting data, MongoDB is **schema-flexible**. You can insert documents with different structures into the same collection. While this offers flexibility, it also means you should think carefully about your data model.

### What Happens During Insert

When you insert a document:

1. MongoDB validates the document structure (if validation rules exist)
2. An `_id` field is automatically generated if not provided
3. The document is written to the collection
4. If the collection doesn't exist, MongoDB creates it automatically

### The `_id` Field

Every document in MongoDB must have a unique `_id` field that acts as the primary key:

- If you don't provide one, MongoDB generates an **ObjectId**
- ObjectIds are 12-byte unique identifiers (timestamp + machine + process + counter)
- You *can* provide your own `_id` (string, number, etc.), but it must be unique

<Tip>
Letting MongoDB generate `_id` values is usually the best choice—ObjectIds are designed to be unique across distributed systems without coordination.
</Tip>

## Insert Methods

Create operations add new documents to a collection. If the collection does not currently exist, insert operations will create the collection.

## `insertOne()`

Inserts a single document into a collection.

```javascript
db.users.insertOne({
  name: "Alice",
  age: 25,
  status: "active"
})
```

**Output:**
```javascript
{
  "acknowledged": true,
  "insertedId": ObjectId("60d5ec...")
}
```

## `insertMany()`

Inserts multiple documents into a collection. Pass an array of documents.

```javascript
db.users.insertMany([
  { name: "Bob", age: 30, status: "inactive" },
  { name: "Charlie", age: 35, status: "active" }
])
```

**Output:**
```javascript
{
  "acknowledged": true,
  "insertedIds": {
    "0": ObjectId("..."),
    "1": ObjectId("...")
  }
}
```

## Ordered vs Unordered Inserts

By default, `insertMany` is **ordered**. If an error occurs during the insertion of one of the documents (e.g., duplicate key error), MongoDB stops inserting the remaining documents.

To allow the remaining documents to be inserted even if one fails, set `ordered: false`.

```javascript
db.users.insertMany([
  { _id: 1, name: "A" },
  { _id: 1, name: "B" }, // Duplicate ID error
  { _id: 2, name: "C" }
], { ordered: false })
```

In this case, "A" and "C" will be inserted, and "B" will fail.

## Summary

- Use `insertOne()` for single documents.
- Use `insertMany()` for multiple documents.
- MongoDB automatically adds an `_id` if you don't provide one.
- `insertMany` is ordered by default; use `{ ordered: false }` to continue on error.
