# CRUD: Read

Reading data is the most common database operation—and the one that can make or break your application's performance. MongoDB provides a powerful query language that lets you find exactly the data you need, efficiently.

## Understanding MongoDB Queries

Unlike SQL's string-based queries, MongoDB uses **JSON-like query documents**. This approach is:

- **Type-safe**: No SQL injection vulnerabilities from string concatenation
- **Composable**: Build complex queries programmatically
- **Intuitive**: If you know JSON, you can write queries

### Query Performance Basics

Every query should be intentional. Poorly written queries can:

- Scan millions of documents instead of using indexes
- Consume excessive memory on large result sets
- Block other operations due to collection-level locks (in older versions)

<Tip>
Always use **projection** to return only the fields you need, and consider **indexes** for frequently queried fields. We'll cover indexing in a later chapter.
</Tip>

## Basic Query Methods

Read operations retrieve documents from a collection; i.e., query a collection for documents.

## `find()` and `findOne()`

- `find(filter)`: Returns a cursor to the matching documents.
- `findOne(filter)`: Returns the first matching document.

```javascript
// Find all documents
db.users.find({})

// Find users with name "Alice"
db.users.find({ name: "Alice" })
```

## Comparison Operators

- `$eq`: Equal to
- `$ne`: Not equal to
- `$gt`: Greater than
- `$gte`: Greater than or equal to
- `$lt`: Less than
- `$lte`: Less than or equal to
- `$in`: In an array
- `$nin`: Not in an array

**Examples:**

```javascript
// Age > 25
db.users.find({ age: { $gt: 25 } })

// Status is "active" OR "pending"
db.users.find({ status: { $in: ["active", "pending"] } })
```

## Logical Operators

- `$or`: Joins query clauses with a logical OR
- `$and`: Joins query clauses with a logical AND
- `$not`: Inverts the effect of a query expression
- `$nor`: Joins query clauses with a logical NOR

**Example:**

```javascript
// Age < 30 AND status = "active"
db.users.find({
  $and: [
    { age: { $lt: 30 } },
    { status: "active" }
  ]
})

// Implicit AND (shorter syntax)
db.users.find({ age: { $lt: 30 }, status: "active" })
```

## Element Operators

- `$exists`: Matches documents that have the specified field.
- `$type`: Selects documents if a field is of the specified type.

```javascript
// Find users who have a "phone" field
db.users.find({ phone: { $exists: true } })
```

## Projection

Projection determines which fields are returned in the matching documents.

```javascript
// Return only name and age (exclude _id)
db.users.find({}, { name: 1, age: 1, _id: 0 })
```

## Summary

- Use `find()` to query data.
- Use comparison operators like `$gt`, `$lt`, `$in` for filtering.
- Use logical operators like `$or`, `$and` for complex logic.
- Use **Projection** to limit the fields returned.
