# Calculus for Machine Learning

**The Big Question**: How do machines learn?

When you train a neural network, it starts with random guesses and gradually gets better. But how? The answer is **calculus** - specifically, derivatives and gradients that tell the model how to improve.

By the end of this course, you'll understand the mathematics behind every "learning" algorithm in ML.

## Why Calculus?

### The Learning Problem

Imagine you're trying to minimize a cost function:

```python
# Your model makes predictions
predictions = model(data)

# How wrong are we?
cost = (predictions - actual_values) ** 2

# Question: How do we reduce this cost?
# Answer: Calculus!
```

**Calculus tells us**:
- Which direction to move (gradient)
- How far to move (learning rate)
- When to stop (convergence)

## What You'll Learn

### Module 1: Derivatives & Rates of Change
**The Question**: How fast is something changing?

**You'll learn**:
- What derivatives really mean (not just formulas)
- How to find the steepest direction
- Why neural networks need derivatives

**Examples**:
- Minimizing business costs
- Optimizing student learning rates  
- Tuning recommendation systems

---

### Module 2: Gradients & Multivariable Calculus
**The Question**: How do we optimize with many variables?

**You'll learn**:
- Partial derivatives (change in one direction)
- Gradients (change in all directions)
- Why gradients point "uphill"

**Examples**:
- Optimizing multiple business metrics
- Balancing student workload across subjects
- Tuning multiple recommendation parameters

- How backpropagation works
- Why deep learning is possible

**Examples**:
- Multi-stage business processes
- Cascading effects in education
- Multi-layer recommendation systems

---

## Real-World Applications

**After this course, you'll understand**:
- How TensorFlow/PyTorch compute gradients
- Why Adam optimizer works better than SGD
- How to debug training problems
- When to use different optimizers
- How to implement custom loss functions

---

## Course Philosophy

### Teach the "Why"

**Bad explanation**: "The derivative of x² is 2x"
**Our explanation**: "The derivative tells you: if you increase x by a tiny amount, how much does x² change? For x², it changes by 2x times that amount. Here's why..."

### Make it Relatable

We use examples you encounter daily:
- Minimizing costs (business)
- Optimizing learning (education)
- Improving recommendations (entertainment)

### Build Intuition

- Visualize everything
- Use analogies
- Connect to physical intuition
- Show before telling
