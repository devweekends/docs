# State & useState Hook

**State** is a built-in React object that is used to contain data or information about the component. A component's state can change over time; whenever it changes, the component re-renders.

## The `useState` Hook

Hooks are functions that let you "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from function components. `useState` is the most basic hook.

### Importing useState

```javascript
import { useState } from 'react';
```

### Declaring State

`useState` returns an array with two values:
1.  The current state value.
2.  A function that lets you update it.

```javascript
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
```

- `count`: The state variable (initialized to `0`).
- `setCount`: The function to update `count`.

### Using State

```javascript
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Updating State Correctly

### 1. Don't Modify State Directly

Never do this:
```javascript
// Wrong
count = count + 1;
```

Always use the setter function:
```javascript
// Correct
setCount(count + 1);
```

### 2. Updates Based on Previous State

If the new state depends on the previous state, pass a function to the setter. This ensures you are working with the most up-to-date value.

```javascript
// Safer for multiple updates
setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1);
```

## State with Objects

When using objects in state, remember that `useState` replaces the entire object, it doesn't merge it (unlike `this.setState` in class components).

```javascript
const [user, setUser] = useState({ name: 'Alice', age: 25 });

const updateName = () => {
  // Wrong: age will be lost
  // setUser({ name: 'Bob' }); 

  // Correct: Spread previous state
  setUser({ ...user, name: 'Bob' });
};
```

## Multiple State Variables

You can use `useState` multiple times in a single component.

```javascript
function UserProfile() {
  const [name, setName] = useState('Alice');
  const [age, setAge] = useState(25);
  const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(true);
  
  // ...
}
```

## Summary

- **State** allows components to change over time and trigger re-renders.
- `useState` is the hook to add state to functional components.
- It returns `[currentValue, setValue]`.
- Never mutate state directly.
- Use the **spread operator** (`...`) when updating objects or arrays in state.
