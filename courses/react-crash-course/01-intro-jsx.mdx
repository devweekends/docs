# Introduction to React

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, developed by Facebook. It allows developers to build reusable UI components and manage the state of their applications efficiently.

## Why React?

1.  **Component-Based**: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.
2.  **Declarative**: Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.
3.  **Virtual DOM**: React uses a virtual DOM to improve performance. It calculates the minimal set of changes needed to update the actual DOM.
4.  **Ecosystem**: A massive ecosystem of libraries, tools, and community support.

## Setting Up a React Project

The easiest way to start a new React project is using **Vite** (recommended) or Create React App.

### Using Vite

```bash
npm create vite@latest my-react-app -- --template react
cd my-react-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

## JSX (JavaScript XML)

JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript. It looks like HTML, but it allows you to write HTML structures within JavaScript code.

```javascript
const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
```

### Rules of JSX

1.  **Return a Single Root Element**: You must wrap adjacent elements in a parent tag or a Fragment (`<>...</>`).
    ```javascript
    // Wrong
    return (
      <h1>Header</h1>
      <p>Paragraph</p>
    );

    // Correct
    return (
      <>
        <h1>Header</h1>
        <p>Paragraph</p>
      </>
    );
    ```

2.  **Close All Tags**: Self-closing tags must end with a slash (e.g., `<img />`, `<br />`).

3.  **camelCase Properties**: HTML attributes become camelCase in JSX.
    - `class` -> `className`
    - `onclick` -> `onClick`
    - `tabindex` -> `tabIndex`

4.  **JavaScript Expressions**: You can embed any valid JavaScript expression inside curly braces `{}`.

    ```javascript
    const name = "Josh";
    const element = <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>;
    ```

## Conditional Rendering

You can use JavaScript operators like `if` or the ternary operator inside JSX.

```javascript
const isLoggedIn = true;

return (
  <div>
    {isLoggedIn ? <button>Logout</button> : <button>Login</button>}
  </div>
);
```

## Summary

- **React** is a library for building UIs using components.
- **Vite** is a fast build tool for setting up React projects.
- **JSX** allows writing HTML-like syntax in JavaScript.
- Remember to use `className` instead of `class`.
- Wrap multiple elements in a **Fragment** (`<>...</>`).
