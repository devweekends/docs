# Optimization & Deployment

## Performance Optimization

### 1. Code Splitting (Lazy Loading)

Load components only when they are needed.

```javascript
import React, { Suspense, lazy } from 'react';

const About = lazy(() => import('./About'));

function App() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <About />
    </Suspense>
  );
}
```

### 2. React.memo

Prevents functional components from re-rendering if their props haven't changed.

```javascript
const MyComponent = React.memo(function MyComponent(props) {
  /* render using props */
});
```

### 3. useCallback & useMemo

- **useCallback**: Memoizes a function definition so it doesn't change on every render (useful when passing functions to child components).
- **useMemo**: Memoizes the result of a calculation.

```javascript
const memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => {
  doSomething(a, b);
}, [a, b]);

const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);
```

## Deployment

### Building for Production

When you are ready to deploy, run the build command.

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates a `dist` (or `build`) folder with optimized static files (minified HTML, CSS, JS).

### Deploying to Vercel

1.  Push your code to GitHub.
2.  Go to Vercel and import your repository.
3.  Vercel automatically detects Vite/Create React App and configures the build settings.
4.  Click Deploy.

### Deploying to Netlify

1.  Drag and drop your `dist` folder to Netlify Drop.
2.  Or connect to GitHub for continuous deployment.

### Handling Client-Side Routing on Static Hosts

If you use React Router, you might get 404 errors when refreshing a page like `/about`. You need to configure your host to redirect all requests to `index.html`.

- **Netlify**: Create a `_redirects` file in `public`:
  ```
  /*  /index.html  200
  ```
- **Vercel**: Create `vercel.json`:
  ```json
  {
    "rewrites": [{ "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/" }]
  }
  ```

## Summary

- Use **Lazy Loading** to reduce initial bundle size.
- Use **React.memo**, **useCallback**, and **useMemo** to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- Run `npm run build` to generate production assets.
- Deploy to static hosts like **Vercel** or **Netlify**.
- Configure **rewrites** for client-side routing support.
