# Lists & Keys

You can build collections of elements and include them in JSX using curly braces `{}`.

## Rendering Multiple Components

Usually, you will render lists inside a component. We use the JavaScript `map()` method to transform an array of data into an array of elements.

```javascript
function NumberList(props) {
  const numbers = props.numbers;
  const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
    <li key={number.toString()}>
      {number}
    </li>
  );
  
  return (
    <ul>{listItems}</ul>
  );
}

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
// Usage: <NumberList numbers={numbers} />
```

## Keys

Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity.

### Why Keys Matter?

When React renders a list, it compares the new list with the old list.
- If an item has the same key, React assumes it is the same component and updates it.
- If a key is missing, React assumes the item was deleted.
- If a new key appears, React creates a new component.

Without keys (or using index as keys), reordering a list can cause performance issues or bugs with component state.

### Choosing the Right Key

The best way to pick a key is to use a string that uniquely identifies a list item among its siblings. Most often you would use IDs from your data.

```javascript
const todoItems = todos.map((todo) =>
  <li key={todo.id}>
    {todo.text}
  </li>
);
```

### Using Index as Key (Not Recommended)

When you don't have stable IDs for rendered items, you may use the item index as a key as a last resort.

```javascript
// Only do this if items have no IDs and the list will NOT be reordered
const todoItems = todos.map((todo, index) =>
  <li key={index}>
    {todo.text}
  </li>
);
```

**Warning**: Using indexes for keys can negatively impact performance and may cause issues with component state if the list order changes.

## Summary

- Use `.map()` to render lists of elements.
- Always provide a unique `key` prop for each item in a list.
- Keys must be unique among siblings.
- Avoid using the array index as a key unless the list is static (never reordered/filtered).
