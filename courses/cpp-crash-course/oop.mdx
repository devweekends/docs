# OOP in C++

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) lets you model real-world things as code. C++ supports OOP with classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.

## What is a Class?
A class is a blueprint for objects. Think of it as a recipe; objects are the cakes you bake from it.

```cpp
class Person {
private:
    std::string name;
    int age;
public:
    Person(std::string n, int a) : name(n), age(a) {}
    std::string getName() const { return name; }
    void setAge(int a) { age = a; }
};

Person alice("Alice", 30);
std::cout << alice.getName(); // Alice
```

**Tip:** Use `private` to hide data, `public` for the interface.

---

## Inheritance
Inheritance lets you create new classes from existing ones. For example, a `Dog` is an `Animal`.

```cpp
class Animal {
protected:
    std::string name;
public:
    Animal(std::string n) : name(n) {}
    virtual void makeSound() = 0; // Pure virtual (abstract)
    virtual ~Animal() {}
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    Dog(std::string n) : Animal(n) {}
    void makeSound() override {
        std::cout << name << " says Woof!\n";
    }
};

Dog d("Buddy");
    Dog(std::string n) : Animal(n) {}
```

---

## Polymorphism
Polymorphism lets you treat different objects through a common interface.

```cpp
void animalSound(Animal* a) {
    a->makeSound();
}

Dog d("Max");
    void makeSound() override {
```

---

## Encapsulation
Keep data safe by hiding it inside classes and exposing only what’s needed.

---

## Mini-Exercise
- Create a `Shape` base class and derive `Circle` and `Rectangle`.
- Add a virtual `area()` method and override it in each derived class.

---

**Next:** [STL](./stl)
        std::cout << name << " says Woof!\n";
    }
};
```


## Operator Overloading
Operator overloading lets you define how operators work for your classes.

```cpp
class Complex {
    double real, imag;
public:
    Complex(double r, double i) : real(r), imag(i) {}
    Complex operator+(const Complex& other) {
        return Complex(real + other.real, imag + other.imag);
    }
};
```

---

## Advanced: Abstract Classes & Interfaces

Abstract classes have at least one pure virtual function. They act as interfaces.

```cpp
class Shape {
public:
    virtual double area() const = 0; // Pure virtual
    virtual ~Shape() {}
};

class Circle : public Shape {
    double r;
public:
    Circle(double radius) : r(radius) {}
    double area() const override { return 3.14 * r * r; }
};
```

## Practical: Simple Bank Account Class

Design a class for a bank account with deposit, withdraw, and balance methods. Add error checking for negative balances.

---

## Challenge: Multiple Inheritance

Create a class that inherits from two base classes. What problems can arise?
