# C++ Crash Course

> **C++** is the language of performance. From operating systems and game engines to high-frequency trading and AI infrastructure, C++ powers the world's most critical systems.

This crash course is designed to take you from the basics to advanced modern C++ (C++17/20) concepts quickly but deeply. We focus on **modern best practices**, **memory safety**, and **performance**.

## Why C++?

Despite being over 40 years old, C++ remains dominant. Why?

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Unmatched Performance" icon="gauge-high">
    Direct hardware access and zero-cost abstractions allow you to write code that runs as fast as the machine allows.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Control" icon="microchip">
    Precise control over memory management, system resources, and hardware integration.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Portability" icon="globe">
    Write once, compile anywhere. C++ runs on everything from microcontrollers to supercomputers.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Modern Features" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    Modern C++ (C++11 through C++23) introduces features like smart pointers, lambdas, and coroutines that make code safer and more expressive.

## Course Roadmap

This course is structured to build your mental model of how C++ works under the hood.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Fundamentals">
    Understand the compilation process, syntax, types, and control flow.
    [Start Learning](/courses/cpp-crash-course/fundamentals)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Memory Mastery">
    The heart of C++. Pointers, references, stack vs. heap, and RAII.
    [Go Deep](/courses/cpp-crash-course/pointers-memory)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Object-Oriented Design">
    Classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
    [Explore OOP](/courses/cpp-crash-course/oop)
  </Step>
  <Step title="The STL">
    Don't reinvent the wheel. Master vectors, maps, algorithms, and iterators.
    [Master STL](/courses/cpp-crash-course/stl)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Modern C++">
    Level up with C++17/20 features: smart pointers, lambdas, concepts, and ranges.
    [Go Modern](/courses/cpp-crash-course/modern-cpp)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of programming concepts (variables, loops, functions).
- A C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC).
- A code editor (VS Code, CLion, or Visual Studio).

## The "Zero-Overhead" Principle

One of the guiding principles of C++ is the **Zero-Overhead Principle**:
1. **What you don't use, you don't pay for.** (No hidden costs).
2. **What you do use, you couldn't hand-code any better.** (Abstractions are efficient).

Keep this in mind as you learn. Every feature in C++ is designed with performance in mind.
