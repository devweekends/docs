# C++ Crash Course

> **Welcome!** This crash course is designed to take you from zero to productive in C++. Whether you're a complete beginner or coming from another language, you'll learn the essentials, modern best practices, and how to write real-world C++ code.

## Why Learn C++?
C++ is a powerful, high-performance language used in game development, embedded systems, finance, AI, and more. It combines low-level memory control with high-level abstractions, making it both versatile and challenging.

## Who is this for?
- Beginners with no prior C++ experience
- Programmers coming from Python, Java, or C
- Anyone wanting to understand modern C++ (C++11 and beyond)

## What You'll Learn
- **Fundamentals:** Syntax, variables, types, control flow
- **Pointers & Memory:** How C++ manages memory, pointers, references, and RAII
- **OOP:** Classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation
- **STL:** Using the Standard Template Library for containers and algorithms
- **Modern C++:** Features from C++11/14/17/20 that make your code safer and easier

## How to Use This Course
Each section contains:
- **Concept explanations** with analogies
- **Code examples** with comments
- **Common mistakes** and best practices
- **Mini-exercises** to reinforce learning
