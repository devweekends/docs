# HIPAA Fundamentals

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is the cornerstone of healthcare data protection in the United States. Understanding its requirements is essential before building any healthcare application.

<Info>
**Learning Objectives**:
- Identify the 18 HIPAA identifiers
- Understand covered entities and business associates
- Know the Privacy Rule vs Security Rule
- Understand breach notification requirements
</Info>

## What is HIPAA?

HIPAA was enacted in 1996 and has been updated multiple times, most significantly with the HITECH Act in 2009. It establishes national standards for:

## Protected Health Information (PHI)

PHI is any information about health status, provision of health care, or payment for health care that can be linked to an individual.

<Frame caption="The 18 HIPAA PHI Identifiers">
  <img src="/images/courses/hipaa-compliance/hipaa-phi-identifiers.svg" alt="Visual representation of the 18 HIPAA identifiers that create PHI" />
</Frame>

### The 18 HIPAA Identifiers

When any of these identifiers is associated with health information, it becomes PHI:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Direct Identifiers">
    | # | Identifier | Examples |
    |---|------------|----------|
    | 1 | **Names** | Full name, maiden name, alias |
    | 2 | **Geographic data** | Street address, city (smaller than state) |
    | 3 | **Dates** | Birth date, admission date, discharge date, death date |
    | 4 | **Phone numbers** | Home, mobile, work |

### PHI vs PII vs ePHI

```python
# Understanding the differences

class DataClassification:
    """
    PII (Personally Identifiable Information):
    - Any data that can identify an individual
    - Regulated by various laws (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
    
    PHI (Protected Health Information):
    - PII + Health Information
    - Regulated by HIPAA
    
    ePHI (Electronic PHI):
    - PHI in electronic form
    - Subject to HIPAA Security Rule
    """
    
    @staticmethod
    def is_phi(data: dict) -> bool:
        """Check if data contains PHI"""
        has_health_info = any([
            'diagnosis' in data,
            'treatment' in data,
            'prescription' in data,
            'medical_record' in data,
            'lab_results' in data,
        ])
        
        has_identifier = any([
            'name' in data,
            'ssn' in data,
            'email' in data,
            'phone' in data,

            'mrn' in data,
        ])
        
        return has_health_info and has_identifier

# Examples

## Covered Entities & Business Associates

<Frame caption="Covered Entities and Business Associates">
  <img src="/images/courses/hipaa-compliance/hipaa-covered-entities.svg" alt="HIPAA Covered Entities and Business Associates relationship diagram" />
</Frame>

### Who Must Comply with HIPAA?

Covered entities and their business associates are directly subject to HIPAA regulations:

### Business Associate Agreement (BAA)

If you're building healthcare software, you'll need a BAA with covered entities:

```python
# Key elements of a Business Associate Agreement

class BusinessAssociateAgreement:
    """
    Required contractual elements between 
    Covered Entity and Business Associate
    """
    
    required_provisions = [
        "Permitted uses and disclosures of PHI",
        "Prohibition on unauthorized use/disclosure",
        "Implementation of appropriate safeguards",
        "Reporting of security incidents and breaches",
        "Ensuring subcontractors agree to same restrictions",
        "Access to PHI for individual rights requests",
        "Amendment of PHI when requested",
        "Accounting of disclosures",
        "Compliance with Security Rule requirements",
        "Return or destruction of PHI at termination",
    ]
    
    # Cloud Provider BAAs
    cloud_baa_support = {
        "AWS": "Available via AWS Artifact",
        "GCP": "Available via Cloud Console",
        "Azure": "Available via Trust Center",
        "Heroku": "Available with Shield plans",
        "MongoDB Atlas": "Available with dedicated plans",
    }
```

<Warning>
**Critical**: Never handle PHI without a signed BAA in place! This includes:
- Development and testing with real PHI
- Storing PHI in cloud services
- Using third-party analytics on PHI
</Warning>

## The Privacy Rule

The Privacy Rule establishes standards for protecting PHI and gives patients rights over their health information.

### Key Privacy Principles

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Minimum Necessary" icon="minimize">
    Only use or disclose the minimum amount of PHI necessary to accomplish the intended purpose.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Notice of Privacy Practices" icon="file-contract">
    Patients must receive notice of how their PHI may be used and their rights.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Patient Rights" icon="user-check">
    Patients can access, amend, and receive an accounting of disclosures of their PHI.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Authorization" icon="signature">
    Most uses beyond treatment, payment, and operations require patient authorization.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Permitted Uses Without Authorization

```python
# PHI can be used/disclosed without authorization for:

class PermittedDisclosures:
    """Uses that don't require patient authorization"""
    
    WITHOUT_AUTHORIZATION = [
        # Treatment, Payment, Healthcare Operations (TPO)
        "treatment",           # Providing care
        "payment",             # Billing, claims
        "healthcare_ops",      # Quality assessment, training

        "organ_donation",      # Organ procurement
        "coroners",            # Death investigations
        "national_security",   # Intelligence activities
    ]
    
    REQUIRES_AUTHORIZATION = [
        "marketing",           # Marketing communications
        "sale_of_phi",         # Selling PHI
        "psychotherapy_notes", # Mental health notes
        "third_party_apps",    # Patient-authorized apps

## Breach Notification Rule

When a breach occurs, specific notification requirements apply:

### What Constitutes a Breach?

```python

    A breach is unauthorized acquisition, access, use, or 
    disclosure of PHI that compromises its security or privacy

## De-identification

De-identified data is not PHI and not subject to HIPAA. There are two methods:

### Expert Determination

A qualified expert determines that the risk of re-identification is very small.

### Safe Harbor Method

Remove all 18 identifiers and have no actual knowledge that remaining information could identify an individual.

```python
class DeIdentification:
    """HIPAA Safe Harbor de-identification"""
    
    identifiers_to_remove = [
        "names",
        "geographic_subdivisions_smaller_than_state",
        "dates_except_year",  # if over 89, use 90+
        "phone_numbers",
        "fax_numbers",
        "email_addresses",
        "ssn",
        "medical_record_numbers",
        "health_plan_beneficiary_numbers",
        "account_numbers",
        "certificate_license_numbers",
        "vehicle_identifiers",
        "device_identifiers",
        "urls",
        "ip_addresses",
        "biometric_identifiers",
        "full_face_photos",
        "other_unique_identifiers",
    ]
    
    def safe_harbor_deidentify(self, record: dict) -> dict:
        """Remove all 18 identifiers"""
        deidentified = record.copy()
        
        for identifier in self.identifiers_to_remove:
            if identifier in deidentified:
                del deidentified[identifier]
        
        # Handle dates - keep only year
        if "date_of_birth" in deidentified:
            year = deidentified["date_of_birth"].year
            if year < 1935:  # Over 89 years old
                deidentified["age_group"] = "90+"
            else:
                deidentified["birth_year"] = year
            del deidentified["date_of_birth"]
        
        # Handle geographic data - keep only state
        if "address" in deidentified:
            deidentified["state"] = deidentified["address"].get("state")
            del deidentified["address"]
            
        return deidentified
```
