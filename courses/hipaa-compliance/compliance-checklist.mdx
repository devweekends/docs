## Introduction

This module provides comprehensive checklists and frameworks to validate your organization's compliance readiness. Use these as both a planning tool and an ongoing compliance verification resource.

<Note>
**Audit-Ready Documentation**

These checklists are designed to be audit-ready. Complete them thoroughly and maintain evidence for each item.

## Business Associate Agreements (BAA)

### Understanding BAAs

A Business Associate Agreement is a legally binding contract that ensures all parties handling PHI maintain appropriate safeguards.

<Warning>
**Critical Requirement**

You **MUST** have signed BAAs with EVERY vendor that can access, store, process, or transmit PHI before sharing any data with them.
</Warning>

### When You Need a BAA

```

### Common Vendors Requiring BAAs

| Vendor Type | Examples | BAA Considerations |
|-------------|----------|-------------------|
| **Cloud Providers** | AWS, Azure, GCP | All offer BAAs; must be signed before deployment |
| **Database Services** | MongoDB Atlas, Supabase | Verify HIPAA-eligible tiers |
| **Email Services** | SendGrid, Mailgun | Many don't sign BAAs; use HIPAA-compliant alternatives |
| **Analytics** | Google Analytics | Standard GA doesn't support BAA; use alternatives |
| **LLM Providers** | OpenAI, Anthropic | Check current BAA availability |
| **Payment Processors** | Stripe | May access names; evaluate if PHI |
| **Customer Support** | Zendesk, Intercom | Often contain PHI in tickets |

## Risk Assessment Framework

### HIPAA Risk Assessment Checklist

HIPAA requires documented risk assessments. Use this comprehensive framework:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Scope Definition">
    Document what systems, applications, and processes handle PHI:
    
    ```yaml
    risk_assessment_scope:
      applications:
        - name: "Patient Portal"
          phi_types: ["demographics", "medical_records", "billing"]
          data_stores: ["PostgreSQL", "S3"]
          access_methods: ["web", "mobile_api"]
          
        - name: "AI Chat Assistant"
          phi_types: ["chat_history", "health_queries"]
          data_stores: ["PostgreSQL", "Redis"]
          access_methods: ["api"]
          
      infrastructure:
        - "AWS us-east-1"
        - "AWS us-west-2 (DR)"
        
      third_parties:
        - name: "OpenAI"
          purpose: "LLM processing"
          baa_status: "signed"
          baa_date: "2024-01-15"
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Threat Identification">
    Identify potential threats to PHI:
    
    | Threat Category | Specific Threats | Likelihood | Impact |
    |-----------------|------------------|------------|--------|
    | **External Attacks** | SQL injection, XSS | Medium | High |
    | **Unauthorized Access** | Credential theft | Medium | Critical |
    | **Insider Threats** | Employee misconduct | Low | High |
    | **Physical** | Server room breach | Low | High |
    | **Natural Disasters** | Fire, flood | Low | Critical |
    | **System Failures** | Database corruption | Medium | High |
    | **Human Error** | Misdirected emails | High | Medium |
  </Step>

  <Step title="Vulnerability Assessment">
    Document current vulnerabilities:
    
    ```python
    # Vulnerability Assessment Template
    vulnerabilities = [
        {
            "id": "VULN-001",
            "category": "access_control",
            "description": "Legacy system lacks MFA",
            "affected_systems": ["patient_portal_v1"],
            "cvss_score": 7.5,
            "remediation_plan": "Implement MFA by Q2 2024",
            "status": "in_progress"
        },
        {
            "id": "VULN-002", 
            "category": "encryption",
            "description": "Some backups not encrypted",
            "affected_systems": ["backup_server_1"],
            "cvss_score": 8.0,
            "remediation_plan": "Enable encryption at rest",
            "status": "remediated"
        }
    ]
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Risk Analysis">
    Calculate risk levels:
    
    ```
    Risk Level = Likelihood × Impact
    
    ┌─────────────┬───────────────────────────────────┐
    │  Likelihood │           Impact                  │
    │             │  Low   │ Medium │  High │Critical │
    ├─────────────┼────────┼────────┼───────┼─────────┤
    │ Rare        │   1    │   2    │   3   │    4    │
    │ Unlikely    │   2    │   4    │   6   │    8    │
    │ Possible    │   3    │   6    │   9   │   12    │

    Risk Ratings:
    1-4:   LOW (Accept with monitoring)
    5-9:   MEDIUM (Mitigation required)
    10-15: HIGH (Immediate action needed)
    16-20: CRITICAL (Stop processing until resolved)
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Mitigation Planning">
    Create remediation plans for identified risks:
    
    ```yaml
    risk_mitigation_plan:
      - risk_id: "RISK-001"
        description: "Unauthorized access to patient records"
        current_risk_level: 12
        controls:
          - type: "preventive"
            control: "Implement role-based access control"
            status: "completed"
            
          - type: "detective"
            control: "Real-time access monitoring"
            status: "in_progress"
            
          - type: "corrective"
            control: "Automated session termination"
            status: "planned"
            
        residual_risk_level: 4
        owner: "Security Team"
        target_date: "2024-06-30"
    ```
  </Step>
