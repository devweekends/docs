# Docker Networking & Volumes

Learn how containers communicate with each other and the outside world, and how to persist data.

---

## Docker Networking

Docker provides several network drivers to control how containers communicate.

### 1. Bridge Network (Default)
The default network driver. Containers on the same bridge network can communicate via IP address or container name (DNS).
- **Isolation**: Containers on different bridge networks cannot communicate.
- **Use Case**: Standalone containers communicating on the same host.

```bash
# Create a custom bridge network (Recommended)
docker network create my-net

# Run containers on this network
docker run -d --name db --network my-net postgres
docker run -d --name app --network my-net my-app

# 'app' can now reach 'db' using the hostname "db"
```

### 2. Host Network
Removes network isolation between the container and the Docker host.
- **Performance**: Best performance (no NAT).
- **Port Conflicts**: Container ports map directly to host ports.

```bash
docker run --network host nginx
# Nginx is now accessible on host's port 80 directly
```

### 3. None Network
Disables all networking.
- **Use Case**: Security-sensitive batch jobs that don't need network access.

```bash
docker run --network none alpine
```

### DNS Resolution
Docker has an embedded DNS server.
- On default `bridge` network: DNS by container name is **NOT** supported (only IP).
- On **custom** networks: DNS by container name **IS** supported.

## Docker Volumes

Containers are ephemeral. When they stop, their filesystem is lost. **Volumes** persist data.

### 1. Named Volumes (Recommended)
Managed by Docker. Stored in `/var/lib/docker/volumes/` (on Linux).

```bash
# Create volume
docker volume create db-data

# Mount volume
docker run -d \
  -v db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
  postgres
```

### 2. Bind Mounts
Maps a specific file or directory on the **host** to the container.
- **Use Case**: Development (live reloading code), sharing config files.

```bash
# Mount current directory to /app
docker run -d \
  -v $(pwd):/app \
  node:18-alpine
```

### 3. Tmpfs Mounts
Stored in the host's memory only. Never written to disk.
- **Use Case**: Storing sensitive secrets or high-performance temporary data.

```bash
docker run --tmpfs /run/secrets my-app
```

## Managing Networks & Volumes

```bash
# List networks
docker network ls

# Inspect network (see connected containers)
docker network inspect my-net

# Remove unused networks
docker network prune

# List volumes
docker volume ls

# Remove unused volumes
docker volume prune
```

---

## Key Takeaways

- Always use **Custom Bridge Networks** for inter-container communication.
- Use **Named Volumes** for database persistence.
- Use **Bind Mounts** for development (code reloading).
- Use **Host Networking** only when performance is critical and port conflicts aren't an issue.
