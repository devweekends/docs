## The Story Behind RabbitMQ

**2007**: Rabbit Technologies created RabbitMQ to implement AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol).

**The Problem**:
- Tight coupling between services
- Lost messages during failures
- Difficult to scale distributed systems
- No standard messaging protocol

**The Solution**: RabbitMQ
- Reliable message delivery
- Flexible routing
- Multiple messaging patterns
- Language-agnostic (AMQP protocol)

**Today**: RabbitMQ powers:
- Instagram (message queuing)
- Reddit (asynchronous tasks)
- Uber (event-driven architecture)
- NASA (mission-critical systems)

**Acquired by**: VMware (2013), now part of Broadcom
