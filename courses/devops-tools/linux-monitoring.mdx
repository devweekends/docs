# Linux System Monitoring

As a DevOps engineer, you need to know what's happening on your servers. Is the CPU high? Is memory full? Is the disk slow?

---

## 1. Real-Time Monitoring

### `top` / `htop`
The task manager of Linux. Shows CPU, Memory, and running processes.
- **htop** is a more user-friendly, colorful version of top.

```bash
# Install htop
sudo apt install htop

# Run it
htop
```

**Key Metrics**:
- **Load Average**: System load over 1, 5, and 15 minutes. (If load > number of cores, system is overloaded).
- **Mem**: RAM usage. Green is used, Yellow is cache (good!).

### `free`
Check memory usage.

```bash
free -h
#      total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
# Mem: 15Gi       4.2Gi       5.1Gi       200Mi       6.1Gi       10Gi
```

---

## 2. Resource Analysis

### `vmstat` (Virtual Memory Statistics)
Great for spotting bottlenecks.

```bash
vmstat 1  # Update every 1 second
```
- **r**: Processes waiting for CPU (High number = CPU bottleneck).
- **si/so**: Swap in/out (Any number > 0 = RAM bottleneck).

### `iostat` (Input/Output Statistics)
Check disk performance.

```bash
iostat -xz 1
```
- **%util**: Percentage of time the disk was busy. If near 100%, disk is the bottleneck.

---

## 3. Network Monitoring

### `netstat` / `ss`
View active network connections.

```bash
# List all listening ports (TCP/UDP)
ss -tulpn
```

### `iftop`
Bandwidth usage by connection (like top for network).

---

## 4. Log Management

Logs are the source of truth for errors.

### `journalctl` (Systemd Logs)
View logs for services managed by systemd.

```bash
# View all logs
journalctl

# View logs for a specific service
journalctl -u nginx

# Follow logs (tail -f)
journalctl -u nginx -f

# View logs from today
journalctl --since "today"
```

### `/var/log`
Traditional log directory.
- `/var/log/syslog`: General system logs (Ubuntu/Debian).
- `/var/log/auth.log`: Authentication logs (sudo, ssh logins).
- `/var/log/nginx/access.log`: Web server logs.

---

## Key Takeaways

- Use **htop** for a quick overview.
- Use **vmstat** to distinguish CPU vs RAM issues.
- Use **iostat** to find disk bottlenecks.
- Use **journalctl** to debug service failures.
