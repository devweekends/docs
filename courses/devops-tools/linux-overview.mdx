# Linux Crash Course

> **"Software is like sex: it's better when it's free."** — Linus Torvalds

Linux powers 96.3% of the world's top 1 million servers. If you're serious about DevOps, backend development, or cloud infrastructure, Linux mastery is non-negotiable.

## The Story Behind Linux

**1991**: Linus Torvalds, a 21-year-old Finnish student, started writing a free Unix-like kernel as a hobby.

**The Announcement**:
> "I'm doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won't be big and professional like gnu)"  
> — Linus Torvalds, August 25, 1991

**Today**: Linux runs:
- 96.3% of the world's top 1 million servers
- 100% of the world's top 500 supercomputers
- 3+ billion Android devices
- AWS, Google, Facebook, Netflix infrastructure
- SpaceX rockets and the Mars helicopter
