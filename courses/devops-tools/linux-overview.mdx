# Linux Crash Course

> **"Software is like sex: it is better when it is free."** - Linus Torvalds

Linux runs 96.3% of the world's top 1 million servers. All of the top 500 supercomputers. Every Android phone. Most of the internet. The Mars helicopter. If you want to work in tech, Linux is not optional. This course takes you from command-line-curious to shell-wielding confident.

## The Story Behind Linux

**1991**: Linus Torvalds, a 21-year-old Finnish student, started writing a free Unix-like kernel as a hobby.

**The Announcement**:
> "I'm doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won't be big and professional like gnu)"  
> — Linus Torvalds, August 25, 1991

**Today**: Linux runs:
- 96.3% of the world's top 1 million servers
- 100% of the world's top 500 supercomputers
- 3+ billion Android devices
- AWS, Google, Facebook, Netflix infrastructure
- SpaceX rockets and the Mars helicopter
