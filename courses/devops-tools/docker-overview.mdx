# Docker Crash Course

> **"Docker containers wrap a piece of software in a complete filesystem that contains everything needed to run."**

Docker revolutionized software deployment. Learn to build, ship, and run applications anywhere with containers.

## Why Docker Matters

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Consistency" icon="check">
    "It works on my machine" → "It works everywhere"
  </Card>
  <Card title="Isolation" icon="box">
    Each container is isolated, no dependency conflicts
  </Card>
  <Card title="Efficiency" icon="bolt">
    Containers share OS kernel, much lighter than VMs
  </Card>
  <Card title="Portability" icon="truck">
    Build once, run anywhere - dev, staging, production
  </Card>

## The Story Behind Docker

**2013**: Solomon Hykes presented Docker at PyCon. It changed everything.

**The Problem**: 
- "Works on my machine" syndrome
- Complex deployment processes
- Environment inconsistencies
- Slow VM startup times

**The Solution**: Docker containers
- Lightweight (MBs vs GBs)
- Fast startup (seconds vs minutes)
- Consistent environments
- Easy to share and deploy

**Today**: Docker powers:
- Millions of applications
- Every major cloud platform
- CI/CD pipelines worldwide
- Kubernetes (built on containers)

## Docker vs Virtual Machines

| Feature | Docker Containers | Virtual Machines |
|---------|------------------|------------------|
| **Size** | MBs | GBs |
| **Startup** | Seconds | Minutes |
| **Performance** | Native | Overhead |
| **Isolation** | Process-level | Full OS |
| **Resource Usage** | Shared kernel | Separate OS |

**When to use Docker**: Microservices, CI/CD, development environments  
**When to use VMs**: Different OS, strong isolation, legacy apps
