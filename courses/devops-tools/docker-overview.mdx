# Docker Crash Course

> **"Docker containers wrap a piece of software in a complete filesystem that contains everything needed to run."** - Solomon Hykes

Docker killed the "it works on my machine" problem. Before Docker, deploying software was a nightmare of environment mismatches, dependency hell, and configuration drift. Containers changed everything. This course takes you from zero to production-ready Docker skills.

## Why Docker Matters

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Consistency" icon="check">
    The "it works on my machine" problem is dead. Containers guarantee identical environments everywhere.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Isolation" icon="box">
    Each container is a fortress. No more dependency conflicts or "but I have Python 2.7 installed" disasters.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Efficiency" icon="bolt">
    Containers share the OS kernel. We are talking MBs instead of GBs, seconds instead of minutes.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Portability" icon="truck">
    Build once, run anywhere. Your laptop, staging server, production cluster, any cloud provider.

## The Story Behind Docker

**2013**: Solomon Hykes presented Docker at PyCon. It changed everything.

**The Problem**: 
- "Works on my machine" syndrome
- Complex deployment processes
- Environment inconsistencies
- Slow VM startup times

**The Solution**: Docker containers
- Lightweight (MBs vs GBs)
- Fast startup (seconds vs minutes)
- Consistent environments
- Easy to share and deploy

**Today**: Docker powers:
- Millions of applications
- Every major cloud platform
- CI/CD pipelines worldwide
- Kubernetes (built on containers)

## What You'll Learn

<Steps>
  <Step title="Fundamentals">
    Images, containers, Docker architecture, essential commands. The foundation everything else builds on.
    [Start Here](/courses/devops-tools/docker-fundamentals)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Internals Deep Dive">
    Namespaces, cgroups, union filesystems, the Docker daemon. If you love understanding how things actually work, this one is for you.
    [Explore Internals](/courses/devops-tools/docker-internals)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Building Images">
    Dockerfile mastery, layer caching, multi-stage builds. Craft production-grade images that are secure and optimized.
    [Build Images](/courses/devops-tools/docker-images)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Networking and Volumes">
    Container networking, bridge vs host vs overlay, port mapping, data persistence. How containers talk to each other and the outside world.
    [Learn Networking](/courses/devops-tools/docker-networking)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Docker Compose">
    Multi-container applications, service orchestration, development workflows. The bridge between Docker and Kubernetes.
    [Use Compose](/courses/devops-tools/docker-compose)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Best Practices">
    Security hardening, image optimization, production deployment patterns. Ship with confidence.

## Docker vs Virtual Machines

| Feature | Docker Containers | Virtual Machines |
|---------|------------------|------------------|
| **Size** | MBs | GBs |
| **Startup** | Seconds | Minutes |
| **Performance** | Native | Overhead |
| **Isolation** | Process-level | Full OS |
| **Resource Usage** | Shared kernel | Separate OS |

**When to use Docker**: Microservices, CI/CD, development environments  
**When to use VMs**: Different OS, strong isolation, legacy apps

## Course Structure

### Module 1: Fundamentals (2-3 hours)
Docker architecture, images vs containers, the container lifecycle, essential commands you will use daily.

### Module 2: Internals Deep Dive (2-3 hours)
How Docker actually works under the hood. Namespaces, cgroups, union filesystems, OCI specification. **If you love internals, continue. If not, skip to Module 3.**

### Module 3: Building Images (2-3 hours)
Dockerfile mastery, layer caching strategies, multi-stage builds, building for production.

### Module 4: Networking and Volumes (2 hours)
Bridge networks, overlay networks, port mapping, volumes vs bind mounts, data persistence patterns.

### Module 5: Docker Compose (2 hours)
Multi-container applications, service dependencies, development vs production configs.

### Module 6: Best Practices (2 hours)
Security hardening, rootless containers, image scanning, production deployment patterns.
