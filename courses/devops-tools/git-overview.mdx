# Git Crash Course

> **"I'm an egotistical bastard, and I name all my projects after myself. First Linux, now Git."** — Linus Torvalds

Git is the most widely used version control system in the world. It's not just a tool—it's the foundation of modern collaborative software development.

---

## Why Git Matters

Every professional developer uses version control. Here's why Git won:

  <Card title="Distributed" icon="network-wired">
    Every developer has the full history. No single point of failure. Work offline.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Fast" icon="bolt">
    Branching and merging are instant. Designed for the Linux kernel (millions of lines).
  </Card>
  <Card title="Industry Standard" icon="building">
    GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket—all built on Git. 97% of developers use it.

  <Card title="Powerful" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    Branching strategies, rebasing, cherry-picking—handle any workflow.

## The Story Behind Git

**2005**: Linus Torvalds needed a version control system for Linux kernel development. The existing tool (BitKeeper) became proprietary.

**The Solution**: Linus built Git in just **10 days**. His goals:
- Speed (handle Linux kernel scale)
- Distributed (no central server dependency)
- Data integrity (cryptographic hashing)
- Non-linear development (branching)

**Today**: Git powers:
- 100+ million repositories on GitHub
- Every major open source project
- Companies from startups to Google, Microsoft, Facebook

## Git vs Other Version Control Systems

| Feature | Git | SVN | Mercurial |
|---------|-----|-----|-----------|
| **Architecture** | Distributed | Centralized | Distributed |
| **Speed** | Very Fast | Slow | Fast |
| **Branching** | Instant, cheap | Slow, expensive | Fast |
| **Offline Work** | Full functionality | Limited | Full functionality |
| **Market Share** | ~97% | ~2% | ~1% |
| **Learning Curve** | Moderate | Easy | Easy |

**Why Git Won**: Speed + distributed model + GitHub's network effect.

### The Three States

Every file in Git is in one of three states:

1. **Modified**: Changed but not staged
2. **Staged**: Marked for next commit
3. **Committed**: Safely stored in repository

### The Three Areas

1. **Working Directory**: Your actual files
2. **Staging Area (Index)**: Prepared changes
3. **Repository (.git)**: Committed history

## Why Developers Love Git

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Branching is Cheap" icon="code-branch">
    Create a branch in milliseconds. Experiment freely. Delete failed experiments.
    
    ```bash
    git branch feature-x    # Create branch
    git checkout feature-x  # Switch to it
    # Or in one command:
    git checkout -b feature-x
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Complete History" icon="clock-rotate-left">
    Every commit is a snapshot. Travel back in time. Find when bugs were introduced.
    
    ```bash
    git log --oneline --graph --all
    git bisect  # Binary search for bugs
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Collaboration" icon="users">
    Multiple developers, same codebase, no conflicts (mostly). Pull requests for code review.
    
    ```bash
    git pull origin main
    git push origin feature-x
    ```
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Safety" icon="shield">
    SHA-1 hashing ensures data integrity. Almost impossible to lose committed work.
    
    ```bash
    git reflog  # See everything you've done
    git reset --hard HEAD@{1}  # Undo mistakes
    ```
  </Accordion>

## Common Git Workflows

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Feature Branch">
    ```bash
    # Create feature branch
    git checkout -b feature/user-auth
    
    # Make changes, commit
    git add .
    git commit -m "Add user authentication"
    
    # Push to remote
    git push origin feature/user-auth
    
    # Create pull request on GitHub/GitLab
    # After review, merge to main
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Gitflow">
    ```bash
    # Main branches: main, develop
    # Supporting: feature/*, release/*, hotfix/*
    
    # Start feature
    git checkout -b feature/new-feature develop
    
    # Finish feature
    git checkout develop
    git merge --no-ff feature/new-feature
    git branch -d feature/new-feature
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Trunk-Based">
    ```bash
    # Everyone commits to main/trunk
    # Short-lived feature branches (< 1 day)
    
    git checkout -b quick-fix
    # Make changes
    git commit -m "Fix bug"
    git push origin quick-fix
    # Immediate merge after CI passes
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Git Best Practices

<Warning>
**Commit Message Guidelines**:
```
feat: add user authentication
fix: resolve login timeout issue
docs: update README with setup instructions
refactor: simplify database query logic
test: add unit tests for auth service
```

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification.
</Warning>

<Tip>
**Commit Often, Push Regularly**:
- Commit logical units of work
- Write descriptive commit messages
- Push at least daily to backup your work
- Use branches for features, fixes, experiments
</Tip>

## What Makes Git Powerful

1. **Snapshots, Not Diffs**: Git stores complete snapshots, making operations fast
2. **Local Operations**: Most operations are local, no network needed
3. **Integrity**: Everything is checksummed (SHA-1), corruption is detected
4. **Append-Only**: Git generally only adds data, hard to lose committed work
5. **Branching Model**: Branches are just pointers, making them lightweight
