# Git Collaboration

<img src="/images/courses/devops-tools/git-distributed.svg" alt="Git Distributed Model" />

Git's distributed nature makes team collaboration seamless. Learn to work with remote repositories, pull requests, and code review workflows.

---

## Remote Repositories

A remote is a version of your repository hosted elsewhere (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).

### Viewing Remotes

```bash
# List remotes
git remote

# List with URLs
git remote -v

# Show remote details
git remote show origin
```

### Adding Remotes

```bash
# Add a remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo.git

# Add multiple remotes
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original/repo.git

# Change remote URL
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/repo.git
```

---

## Cloning Repositories

```bash
# Clone via HTTPS
git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git

# Clone via SSH
git clone git@github.com:username/repo.git

# Clone specific branch
git clone -b develop https://github.com/username/repo.git

# Shallow clone (faster, less history)
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/username/repo.git
```

---

## Pushing Changes

```bash
# Push to remote
git push origin main

# Push new branch
git push -u origin feature/new-feature
# -u sets upstream tracking

# Push all branches
git push origin --all

# Push tags
git push origin --tags

# Force push (DANGEROUS!)
git push --force origin main
```

<Warning>
**Never force push to shared branches!** It rewrites history and can cause problems for teammates.

Safe alternative:
```bash
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```
</Warning>

---

## Pulling Changes

```bash
# Fetch + merge
git pull origin main

# Fetch only (no merge)
git fetch origin

# Pull with rebase
git pull --rebase origin main

# Pull all branches
git fetch --all
```

### Pull vs Fetch

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `git fetch` | Downloads changes but doesn't merge |
| `git pull` | Downloads and merges (`fetch` + `merge`) |

```bash
# Recommended workflow
git fetch origin
git log origin/main  # Review changes
git merge origin/main  # Merge when ready
```

---

## Working with Forks

### Forking Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Fork on GitHub">
    Click "Fork" button on the repository
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Clone your fork">
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/repo.git
    cd repo
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add upstream remote">
    ```bash
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL-OWNER/repo.git
    git remote -v
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Keep fork updated">
    ```bash
    git fetch upstream
    git checkout main
    git merge upstream/main
    git push origin main
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

## Pull Requests (PRs)

Pull requests are how you propose changes to a repository.

### Creating a Pull Request

```bash
# 1. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/add-search

# 2. Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add search functionality"

# 3. Push to your fork
git push origin feature/add-search

# 4. Go to GitHub and click "Create Pull Request"
```

---

## Code Review

### As a Reviewer

```bash
# Fetch PR branch
git fetch origin pull/123/head:pr-123
git checkout pr-123

# Test locally
npm install
npm test

# Leave comments on GitHub
```

**Good Review Comments**:
- ✅ "Consider using a Map here for O(1) lookup"
- ✅ "This could cause a race condition if..."
- ✅ "Great solution! Minor: variable name could be more descriptive"

**Bad Review Comments**:
- ❌ "This is wrong"
- ❌ "Why did you do it this way?"
- ❌ "I would have done it differently"

### As an Author

```bash
# Address review comments
git add .
git commit -m "refactor: apply review suggestions"
git push origin feature/add-search

# Squash commits before merge (optional)
git rebase -i main
```

---

## Collaboration Workflows

### Centralized Workflow

```bash
# Everyone works on main
git clone https://github.com/team/repo.git
git pull origin main
# ... make changes ...
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add feature"
git pull origin main  # Get latest
git push origin main
```

**Best for**: Small teams, simple projects

### Feature Branch Workflow

```bash
# Each feature gets its own branch
git checkout -b feature/user-profile
# ... work ...
git push origin feature/user-profile
# Create PR
# After review and merge
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git branch -d feature/user-profile
```

**Best for**: Most teams, medium to large projects

### Forking Workflow

```bash
# Fork repo on GitHub
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/repo.git
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL/repo.git

# Create feature
git checkout -b feature/improvement
# ... work ...
git push origin feature/improvement
# Create PR from your fork to original repo
```

**Best for**: Open source projects, external contributors

---

## Handling Common Scenarios

### Syncing Fork with Upstream

```bash
# Fetch upstream changes
git fetch upstream

# Merge into your main
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main

# Push to your fork
git push origin main
```

### Updating PR Branch

```bash
# Method 1: Merge
git checkout feature/my-pr
git merge main
git push origin feature/my-pr

# Method 2: Rebase (cleaner history)
git checkout feature/my-pr
git rebase main
git push --force-with-lease origin feature/my-pr
```

### Resolving PR Conflicts

```bash
# Update your branch
git checkout feature/my-pr
git fetch origin
git merge origin/main

# Resolve conflicts
# ... edit files ...
git add .
git commit

# Push resolution
git push origin feature/my-pr
```

---

## SSH vs HTTPS

### HTTPS

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git
```

**Pros**: Easy setup, works everywhere  
**Cons**: Need to enter credentials (or use credential helper)

### SSH

```bash
git clone git@github.com:username/repo.git
```

**Pros**: No password needed, more secure  
**Cons**: Requires SSH key setup

### Setting Up SSH

```bash
# Generate SSH key
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your.email@example.com"

# Start SSH agent
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

# Add key
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

# Copy public key
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
# Add to GitHub: Settings → SSH Keys → New SSH Key
```

---

## Tags and Releases

### Creating Tags

```bash
# Lightweight tag
git tag v1.0.0

# Annotated tag (recommended)
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"

# Tag specific commit
git tag -a v0.9.0 abc123

# List tags
git tag

# Push tags
git push origin v1.0.0
git push origin --tags  # All tags
```

### Semantic Versioning

```
v1.2.3
│ │ └─ Patch: Bug fixes
│ └─── Minor: New features (backward compatible)
└───── Major: Breaking changes
```

---

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Contributing to Open Source

```bash
# 1. Fork repo on GitHub

# 2. Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/awesome-project.git
cd awesome-project

# 3. Add upstream
git remote add upstream https://github.com/ORIGINAL/awesome-project.git

# 4. Create branch
git checkout -b fix/typo-in-readme

# 5. Make changes
echo "Fixed typo" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "docs: fix typo in README"

# 6. Push to your fork
git push origin fix/typo-in-readme

# 7. Create PR on GitHub

# 8. Keep fork updated
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
git push origin main
```

### Example 2: Team Feature Development

```bash
# 1. Get latest code
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 2. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/payment-integration

# 3. Work and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add Stripe payment integration"

# 4. Push and create PR
git push -u origin feature/payment-integration

# 5. Address review comments
git add .
git commit -m "refactor: apply code review suggestions"
git push origin feature/payment-integration

# 6. After merge, clean up
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git branch -d feature/payment-integration
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Your branch is behind 'origin/main'"

```bash
git pull origin main
```

### "Your branch has diverged"

```bash
# Option 1: Merge
git pull origin main

# Option 2: Rebase
git pull --rebase origin main
```

### "Permission denied (publickey)"

```bash
# Check SSH key
ssh -T git@github.com

# If fails, add SSH key to GitHub
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

### "Failed to push some refs"

```bash
# Someone pushed before you
git pull origin main
git push origin main
```
