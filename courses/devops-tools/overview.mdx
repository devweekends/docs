# DevOps Tools Mastery

> **DevOps** is the bridge between development and operations. Master the tools that power modern software delivery, from version control to container orchestration. This is not surface-level knowledge. We go deep.

This comprehensive course provides crash courses on six essential DevOps tools, taking you from beginner to mid-level proficiency with each. Every tool includes an optional internals deep dive for those who love understanding how things really work.

## Why These Six Tools?

These aren't random choices—they're the core of modern DevOps:

1. **Git**: Every company uses version control. Git is the standard.
2. **Linux**: 96.3% of the world's top 1 million servers run Linux.
3. **Docker**: Containers solved "it works on my machine." Docker made containers accessible.
4. **RabbitMQ**: When you need reliable message queuing, RabbitMQ is battle-tested.
5. **Kafka**: For high-throughput event streaming, Kafka is unmatched (LinkedIn, Netflix, Uber use it).
6. **Kubernetes**: The de facto standard for container orchestration. Used by Google, Microsoft, Amazon.

## Course Philosophy

<Note>
**Practical First, Theory Second**

Each module follows this pattern:
1. **Why it matters**: Real-world context and use cases
2. **Core concepts**: The fundamentals you need to know
3. **Hands-on practice**: Commands, examples, and exercises
4. **Best practices**: Production-ready patterns
5. **Visual learning**: SVG diagrams for complex concepts

We focus on what you'll actually use in real projects, not exhaustive documentation.
</Note>
