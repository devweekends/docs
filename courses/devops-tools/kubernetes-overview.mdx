# Kubernetes Crash Course

> **"Kubernetes is to distributed systems what an operating system is to a computer."** - Kelsey Hightower

Kubernetes (K8s) is not just another tool. It is the operating system for the cloud. Google runs billions of containers on it. Netflix, Spotify, Airbnb - they all bet their infrastructure on Kubernetes. This course takes you from kubectl-curious to production-ready.

  <Card title="Self-Healing" icon="heart-pulse">
    Auto-restart failed containers, replace nodes
  </Card>
  <Card title="Scaling" icon="up-right-and-down-left-from-center">
    Auto-scale based on CPU, memory, custom metrics
  </Card>

## The Story Behind Kubernetes

**2014**: Google open-sourced Kubernetes, based on their internal Borg system.

**The Problem**:
- Managing containers manually doesn't scale
- Need automated deployment and scaling
- Service discovery and load balancing
- Rolling updates without downtime

**The Solution**: Kubernetes
- Declarative configuration
- Self-healing systems
- Horizontal auto-scaling
- Service discovery and load balancing
- Automated rollouts and rollbacks

**Today**: Kubernetes powers:
- **Google**: Runs billions of containers
- **Spotify**: Entire infrastructure
- **Airbnb**: Microservices platform
- **Pokemon Go**: Handled massive scale
- Every major cloud provider (EKS, GKE, AKS)

**CNCF**: Donated to Cloud Native Computing Foundation (2015)

## What You'll Learn

<Steps>
  <Step title="Fundamentals">
    Pods, nodes, clusters, namespaces. The building blocks you need to understand before anything else.
    [Start Here](/courses/devops-tools/kubernetes-fundamentals)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Internals Deep Dive">
    etcd, the scheduler algorithm, controller patterns, CNI/CSI. If you love understanding how things actually work, this one is for you.
    [Explore Internals](/courses/devops-tools/kubernetes-internals)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Workloads">
    Deployments, ReplicaSets, StatefulSets, DaemonSets, Jobs. How to run anything on Kubernetes.
    [Deploy Apps](/courses/devops-tools/kubernetes-workloads)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Services">
    Service types, load balancing, Ingress controllers, DNS. Exposing your applications to the world.
    [Expose Services](/courses/devops-tools/kubernetes-services)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configuration">
    ConfigMaps, Secrets, environment variables. Managing configuration without rebuilding images.
    [Manage Config](/courses/devops-tools/kubernetes-config)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Storage">
    Volumes, PersistentVolumes, PersistentVolumeClaims, StorageClasses. Stateful workloads done right.
    [Handle Storage](/courses/devops-tools/kubernetes-storage)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Helm">
    Package management for Kubernetes. Deploy complex applications with a single command.
    [Use Helm](/courses/devops-tools/kubernetes-helm)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Windows and Linux">
    Platform-specific considerations, Windows containers, hybrid clusters. Real-world complexity.
    [Platform Details](/courses/devops-tools/kubernetes-windows-linux)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Kubernetes vs Docker Swarm

| Feature | Kubernetes | Docker Swarm |
|---------|------------|--------------|
| **Complexity** | High | Low |
| **Features** | Extensive | Basic |
| **Community** | Huge | Small |
| **Adoption** | Industry standard | Declining |
| **Learning Curve** | Steep | Gentle |

**Verdict**: Kubernetes won. Docker Swarm is rarely used in production.

## Course Structure

### Module 1: Fundamentals (2-3 hours)
Cluster architecture, pods, nodes, namespaces. kubectl basics that you will use every single day.

### Module 2: Internals Deep Dive (2-3 hours)
etcd and the Raft consensus protocol, scheduler algorithms, the controller pattern, CNI and CSI interfaces. **If you love internals, continue. If not, skip to Module 3.**

### Module 3: Workloads (2-3 hours)
Deployments for stateless apps, StatefulSets for databases, DaemonSets for node-level services, Jobs and CronJobs for batch processing.

### Module 4: Services (2 hours)
ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer, ExternalName. Ingress controllers. Service discovery and DNS.

### Module 5: Configuration (2 hours)
ConfigMaps for non-sensitive config, Secrets for sensitive data. Environment variables, volume mounts, immutable configurations.

### Module 6: Storage (2 hours)
emptyDir, hostPath, PersistentVolumes, PersistentVolumeClaims, StorageClasses. Dynamic provisioning.

### Module 7: Helm (1-2 hours)
Charts, releases, values files. The package manager that makes complex deployments manageable.

### Module 8: Windows and Linux (1-2 hours)
Windows container support, node selectors, taints and tolerations for heterogeneous clusters.
