# Python Crash Course

> **Python** is the language of simplicity and power. It's the #1 choice for AI, Data Science, and rapid web development.

This crash course takes you from "Hello World" to advanced topics like decorators, generators, and async programming.

## Why Python?

Python's philosophy is "Readability counts."

## Course Roadmap

We will cover the "Pythonic" way of writing code.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Fundamentals">
    Variables, types, control flow, and functions.
    [Start Learning](/courses/python-crash-course/fundamentals)
  </Step>

    Lists, Dictionaries, Sets, and Tuples.
    [Master Data](/courses/python-crash-course/data-structures)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Object-Oriented Programming">
    Classes, inheritance, magic methods, and dataclasses.
    [Explore OOP](/courses/python-crash-course/oop)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Modules & Packages">
    Organizing code, virtual environments, and pip.
    [Organize Code](/courses/python-crash-course/modules-packages)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Advanced Python">
    Decorators, generators, context managers, and async/await.
    [Go Advanced](/courses/python-crash-course/advanced)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Prerequisites

- No prior programming experience required.
- Python 3.10+ installed (`python --version`).
- A code editor (VS Code with Python extension is recommended).

## The Zen of Python

Type `import this` in your Python shell:

> Beautiful is better than ugly.
> Explicit is better than implicit.
> Simple is better than complex.
> ...
> There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.

This course teaches you that "one obvious way."
