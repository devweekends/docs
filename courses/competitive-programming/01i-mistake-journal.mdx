# <Icon icon="book" /> The Mistake Journal System

Every wrong answer contains a lesson. Most competitive programmers make the same mistakes repeatedly because they don't track them. This chapter gives you a **systematic approach to eliminate recurring errors** and accelerate your improvement.

## <Icon icon="brain" /> Why Mistakes Repeat

<Warning>
**The brutal truth:** Without tracking, you will make the same mistake 10+ times before it sticks. With tracking, you can reduce that to 2-3 times.
</Warning>

### The Memory Problem

```cpp
// Week 1: You get WA due to integer overflow
// You fix it and move on

// Week 3: You forget about integer overflow
// You get WA again, spend 30 minutes debugging

// Week 5: Same mistake, same frustration
// You feel like you're not improving

// THE FIX: Write it down. Review it. Never forget.
```

### The 5 Categories of CP Mistakes

<img src="/images/courses/cp/mistake-categories.svg" alt="5 Categories of Mistakes" />

| Category | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Syntax** | Language/compiler errors | Forgetting semicolon, wrong brackets |
| **Logic** | Algorithm is fundamentally wrong | Wrong recurrence relation |
| **Implementation** | Right idea, wrong code | Off-by-one, wrong index |
| **Edge Cases** | Works for most, fails for extremes | n=0, n=1, empty string |
| **Careless** | Silly mistakes under pressure | Wrong variable name, copy-paste error |

## <Icon icon="pencil" /> Setting Up Your Mistake Journal

### Option 1: Notion Template

```markdown
## Mistake Entry #[number]

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Problem:** [Problem Name + Link]
**Mistake Category:** [Syntax / Logic / Implementation / Edge Case / Careless]

### What Happened
[Describe the mistake in 1-2 sentences]

### The Code That Was Wrong
```cpp
// Paste the buggy code here
```

### The Correct Code
```cpp
// Paste the fixed code here
```

### Root Cause Analysis
- Why did I make this mistake?
- What was I thinking when I wrote it?
- What should I have done differently?

### Prevention Strategy
- How will I catch this next time?
- What mental check should I add?
- Any template/snippet to prevent this?

### Tags
#overflow #off-by-one #edge-case #modulo #binary-search
```

### Option 2: Simple Spreadsheet

| Date | Problem | Category | Mistake | Fix | Prevention | Tags |
|------|---------|----------|---------|-----|------------|------|
| 2024-01-15 | CF 1234A | Overflow | Used int for n*n | Cast to ll | Always ll for products | #overflow |
| 2024-01-16 | CF 1235B | Edge | Empty string | Check s.empty() | Test n=0 first | #edge #string |

### Option 3: VS Code Snippets

Create a snippets file that grows from your mistakes:

```json
{
  "Safe Modular Add": {
    "prefix": "modadd",
    "body": [
      "((${1:a} % MOD) + (${2:b} % MOD) + MOD) % MOD"
    ],
    "description": "Mistake #14: Negative mod issue"
  },
  "Binary Search Template": {
    "prefix": "binsearch",
    "body": [
      "int lo = 0, hi = n - 1;",
      "while (lo < hi) {",
      "    int mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2;",
      "    if (${1:condition}) hi = mid;",
      "    else lo = mid + 1;",
      "}",
      "// Answer is at index lo"
    ],
    "description": "Mistake #23: Binary search off-by-one"
  }
}
```

## <Icon icon="database" /> The Master Mistake Database

### Top 50 Common CP Mistakes

Build your own database. Here's a starter:

#### Integer Overflow (THE #1 KILLER)

```cpp
// MISTAKE: Using int for large products
int n = 1e5;
int result = n * n;  // OVERFLOW! 

// FIX: Always use long long for products
long long result = (long long)n * n;  // Correct
```

#### Off-By-One Errors

```cpp
// MISTAKE: Wrong loop bounds
for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
    arr[i] = 0;  // Access arr[n] - out of bounds!
}

// FIX: Use < n for 0-indexed arrays
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    arr[i] = 0;
}
```

#### Modular Arithmetic Pitfalls

```cpp
// MISTAKE: Negative numbers in modulo
int x = -5 % 3;  // Result is -2 in C++!

// FIX: Safe modulo
int safe_mod(int x, int m) {
    return ((x % m) + m) % m;
}
```

#### Binary Search Edge Cases

```cpp
// MISTAKE: Infinite loop
while (lo <= hi) {
    int mid = (lo + hi) / 2;  // Can overflow!
    if (arr[mid] < target) lo = mid;  // INFINITE LOOP!
}

// FIX: Correct binary search
while (lo < hi) {
    int mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2;  // Safe from overflow
    if (arr[mid] < target) lo = mid + 1;
    else hi = mid;
}
```

#### Graph Algorithm Mistakes

```cpp
// MISTAKE: Not resetting visited array between test cases
bool visited[N];

void solve() {
    // visited still has values from previous test!
}

// FIX: Reset at start of each test case
void solve() {
    memset(visited, false, sizeof(visited));
    // or
    fill(visited, visited + n, false);
}
```

#### String Processing Errors

```cpp
// MISTAKE: Using cin >> s for strings with spaces
string s;
cin >> s;  // Only reads until first space!

// FIX: Use getline for full line
getline(cin, s);

// WATCH OUT: After cin >> n, you need cin.ignore()
int n; cin >> n;
cin.ignore();
getline(cin, s);
```

#### Array Initialization

```cpp
// MISTAKE: Assuming global arrays are initialized
int dp[N][M];  // Local: RANDOM values!

// FIX: Always initialize
int dp[N][M] = {};  // All zeros

// or
memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp));
memset(dp, -1, sizeof(dp));  // Works for -1 and 0 only!

// For other values, use fill
fill(&dp[0][0], &dp[0][0] + N*M, INF);
```

### Pre-Coding Checklist

Before you start coding ANY problem, ask:

```markdown
☐ Does this problem involve large numbers? → Use long long
☐ Am I working with arrays? → Double-check bounds
☐ Is there modular arithmetic? → Use safe_mod function
☐ Multiple test cases? → Reset all global variables
☐ String input after integers? → cin.ignore() before getline
☐ Binary search needed? → Use tested template
```

### Pre-Submit Checklist

Before hitting submit, verify:

```markdown
☐ All variables use correct data types
☐ Array indices are within bounds
☐ Edge cases handled (n=0, n=1, empty input)
☐ Output format matches exactly (spaces, newlines)
☐ All test cases produce correct output
☐ No debug statements left in code (cerr, cout)
```

### The "5 Second Rule"

<Warning>
**Before submitting, pause for 5 seconds and scan for:**
1. Data types (int vs long long)
2. Loop bounds (< vs <=)
3. Edge cases (n=0, n=1)
4. Output format (newlines, spaces)
5. Debug output (remove cerr/cout debugging)
</Warning>

## <Icon icon="clipboard" /> Mistake Templates by Topic

### Binary Search Mistakes

```cpp
// Template: Safe binary search (lower bound)
int binary_search_lower(vector<int>& arr, int target) {
    int lo = 0, hi = arr.size();  // hi = size, not size-1
    while (lo < hi) {
        int mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2;  // Prevent overflow
        if (arr[mid] < target) lo = mid + 1;
        else hi = mid;
    }
    return lo;  // First element >= target
}

// Common mistake: Using <= in while condition with this template
// Common mistake: Using (lo + hi) / 2 → can overflow
// Common mistake: lo = mid instead of lo = mid + 1 → infinite loop
```

### DP Mistakes

```cpp
// Template: Safe DP initialization
const long long INF = 1e18;  // Not INT_MAX (adding to it overflows)
vector<vector<long long>> dp(n + 1, vector<long long>(m + 1, INF));

// Common mistakes:
// 1. Using INT_MAX → addition causes overflow
// 2. Wrong dimension order
// 3. Not handling base cases
// 4. Wrong recurrence order (depends on what values)
```

### Graph Mistakes

```cpp
// Template: Safe BFS
void bfs(int start) {
    queue<int> q;
    vector<bool> visited(n + 1, false);  // Always declare locally!
    
    q.push(start);
    visited[start] = true;  // Mark BEFORE pushing
    
    while (!q.empty()) {
        int u = q.front();
        q.pop();
        
        for (int v : adj[u]) {
            if (!visited[v]) {
                visited[v] = true;  // Mark BEFORE pushing
                q.push(v);
            }
        }
    }
}

// Common mistakes:
// 1. Marking visited AFTER pushing → duplicates in queue
// 2. Not resetting visited between test cases
// 3. Wrong graph size (1-indexed vs 0-indexed)
```

## <Icon icon="bolt" /> Quick Reference: The Mistake Lookup Table

When you get WA or TLE, check this table:

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Quick Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----------|
| Wrong Answer on large input | Integer overflow | Cast to `long long` |
| Wrong Answer on sample | Logic error | Re-read problem, trace by hand |
| Wrong Answer test 2 | Edge case (n=1) | Add special case handling |
| Time Limit Exceeded | Algorithm too slow | Optimize or change approach |
| TLE with O(n²) | Need O(n log n) | Use sorting/binary search/map |
| Runtime Error | Array out of bounds | Check all array accesses |
| Runtime Error | Stack overflow | Convert recursion to iteration |
| Wrong Answer random tests | Off-by-one error | Check loop bounds carefully |
| Works locally, fails online | Uninitialized variables | Initialize everything |

### The 3-Strike Rule

If you make the same mistake 3 times:
1. **Create a snippet** to prevent it
2. **Add it to pre-submit checklist**
3. **Teach it to someone else** (explaining cements memory)

### The Mistake Flashcard System

Create flashcards for your top mistakes:

```
FRONT: Integer overflow in multiplication
BACK: Always cast at least one operand to long long
       (long long)a * b NOT (long long)(a * b)
```

Review flashcards weekly before contests.

### The "Never Again" List

Keep a pinned list of your top 5 most frustrating mistakes:

```
MY "NEVER AGAIN" LIST:

1. Integer overflow in n*n → ALWAYS use long long
2. Forgot to reset visited[] → Reset at start of solve()
3. Wrong binary search termination → Use tested template
4. Modulo with negative numbers → Use safe_mod()
5. Reading string after int → Always cin.ignore()
```

Read this before every contest.
