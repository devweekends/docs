## <Icon icon="sun" /> Pre-Contest Routine (2 Hours Before)

### The Warm-Up Protocol

<Warning>
**Never start a rated contest cold.** Your brain needs 15-30 minutes to switch into "competitive mode."
</Warning>

```cpp
// Solve 2-3 easy problems (800-1000 rated) before the contest
// This activates your problem-solving circuits
// Choose problems from topics you're comfortable with
```

<img src="/images/courses/cp/warmup-routine.svg" alt="Warm-up Routine" />

### Pre-Contest Checklist

<Steps>
  <Step title="Physical Preparation (2 hours before)">
    - Light meal (avoid heavy food—blood goes to digestion, not brain)
    - Hydrate well (dehydration = slower thinking)
    - 10 minutes of light movement (walk, stretch)
    - Bathroom break (nothing worse than urgency during problem D)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Technical Setup (1 hour before)">
    - Open your template in VS Code
    - Test compile: make sure everything works
    - Open Codeforces/contest page
    - Clear browser cache if needed
    - Close ALL other tabs and apps
    - Phone on silent, face down
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Mental Preparation (30 minutes before)">
    - Solve 2 easy warm-up problems
    - Review your cheat sheet / templates
    - Take 3 deep breaths
    - Positive self-talk: "I've prepared. I'll do my best."
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Final 5 Minutes">
    - Refresh contest page
    - Have water bottle ready
    - Clear your desk
    - Set a timer visible on screen
    - **Focus. Breathe. Begin.**
  </Step>
</Steps>

## <Icon icon="stopwatch" /> Live Contest Strategy

### The First 5 Minutes

<img src="/images/courses/cp/first-5-minutes.svg" alt="First 5 Minutes Strategy" />

```cpp
// Minute 0-1: Open ALL problems (Ctrl+Click each in new tab)
// Minute 1-3: SCAN all problems (just titles + first line)
// Minute 3-5: Read Problem A fully, start coding

// WHY: Sometimes A is harder than B
// You want awareness of all problems before diving deep
```

### Time Allocation Strategy

| Rating Target | Problem A | Problem B | Problem C | Problem D | Problem E |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Specialist (1400) | 10 min | 20 min | 40 min | 50 min | - |
| Expert (1600) | 8 min | 15 min | 30 min | 40 min | 27 min |
| Candidate Master | 5 min | 10 min | 20 min | 35 min | 40 min |

<Warning>
**The 20-Minute Rule:** If you've spent 20 minutes on a problem with ZERO progress, MOVE ON. Read the next problem. Fresh eyes often find solutions.
</Warning>

### Problem Selection During Contest

<img src="/images/courses/cp/problem-decision.svg" alt="Problem Decision Tree" />

```
For each problem, ask:
1. Do I understand what it's asking? (1 min to decide)
2. Do I see a clear approach? (3 min to decide)
3. Am I confident I can implement it? (5 min to decide)

If any answer is "No" after time limit → SKIP, try next problem
```

### Adaptive Strategy

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="When Stuck on C" icon="lightbulb">
    - Read problem D and E
    - Sometimes D is easier than C for YOUR skill set
    - Getting D before C is perfectly valid
    - Don't let problem order limit you
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="When Everything Seems Hard" icon="fire">
    - Take 30 seconds, close eyes, breathe
    - Go back to the easiest unsolved problem
    - Simplify: solve for n=1, n=2, n=3
    - Sometimes panic blinds you to simple solutions
  </Card>

## <Icon icon="clock" /> Time Management Tactics

### The Pomodoro for CP

<img src="/images/courses/cp/contest-pomodoro.svg" alt="Contest Pomodoro" />

```
2-hour contest breakdown:
[0:00 - 0:30]  Problems A + B (high urgency, quick wins)
[0:30 - 1:00]  Problem C (deep focus)
[1:00 - 1:05]  BREAK: Stand up, stretch, drink water
[1:05 - 1:35]  Problem D (or C if still working)
[1:35 - 2:00]  Final push: debug or attempt E
```

### When to Submit vs When to Test More

```cpp
// SUBMIT FAST if:
// - Problem is clearly correct (greedy with proof)
// - You've tested 3+ edge cases
// - You're running low on time

// TEST MORE if:
// - There are tricky edge cases (n=0, n=1, negative)
// - Implementation was complex
// - You have time remaining
// - Problem has tight constraints (likely tricky cases)
```

### The Last 10 Minutes

<Warning>
**Never start implementing a new solution in the last 10 minutes.** 

Use this time for:
- Debugging current submissions
- Rethinking a problem you skipped
- Stress testing solutions you're unsure about
</Warning>

## <Icon icon="bug" /> Dealing with WA During Contest

### The WA Response Protocol

<img src="/images/courses/cp/wa-protocol.svg" alt="WA Response Protocol" />

<Steps>
  <Step title="Don't Panic (10 seconds)">
    Take a breath. WA is normal. Even tourists get WA.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Check the Obvious (30 seconds)">
    - Integer overflow?
    - Array bounds?
    - Wrong data type (int vs long long)?
    - Output format (newline at end)?
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Trace Sample Case (1 minute)">
    - Does your code produce correct output for samples?
    - If not, debug with samples first
    - If yes, your logic might be wrong on edge cases
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Generate Edge Cases (2 minutes)">
    - n = 1 (minimum size)
    - All same elements
    - All different elements
    - Maximum values
    - Sorted / reverse sorted input
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Stress Test (if time permits)">
    - Generate random small inputs
    - Compare with brute force
    - Find the failing case
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Common WA Causes (Quick Checklist)

```cpp
// 1. Integer Overflow
int a = 1e9, b = 1e9;
int wrong = a * b;  // OVERFLOW!
long long right = (long long)a * b;  // Correct

// 2. Array Index
for(int i = 0; i <= n; i++)  // Should be i < n?

// 3. Uninitialized Variables
int dp[N][M];  // Random values! Use memset or fill

// 4. Modular Arithmetic
ans = (ans + x) % MOD;  // What if x is negative?
ans = ((ans + x) % MOD + MOD) % MOD;  // Safe version

// 5. Off-by-one in Binary Search
while(l < r) vs while(l <= r)  // Different semantics!
```

## <Icon icon="heart-pulse" /> Energy & Focus Management

### The Focus Curve

<img src="/images/courses/cp/focus-curve.svg" alt="Focus Curve" />

```
Typical focus pattern during 2-hour contest:
[0:00 - 0:45]  HIGH focus (use for hardest thinking)
[0:45 - 1:15]  MEDIUM focus (fatigue starts)
[1:15 - 1:30]  DIP (take micro-break if possible)
[1:30 - 2:00]  RECOVERY (adrenaline of deadline)
```

### Micro-Recovery Techniques

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="The 20-20-20 Rule" icon="eye">
    Every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. Prevents eye strain and mental fatigue.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Box Breathing" icon="lungs">
    When stressed: Breathe in 4s → Hold 4s → Out 4s → Hold 4s. Resets your nervous system.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Shoulder Rolls" icon="person">
    3 forward, 3 backward. Releases tension that builds up during intense focus.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Water Sips" icon="glass-water">
    Small sips every 20-30 minutes. Dehydration reduces cognitive performance by 10%+.
  </Card>

## <Icon icon="moon" /> Post-Contest Protocol

### Immediate Post-Contest (First 30 minutes)

<Warning>
**Do NOT immediately upsolve.** Your brain is tired. Rest first.
</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Cool Down (5 minutes)">
    - Stand up, stretch, walk around
    - Drink water
    - Let the adrenaline fade
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Quick Reflection (10 minutes)">
    Write answers to:
    - What went well?
    - What could be better?
    - Any patterns in my mistakes?
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Read Editorial (15 minutes)">
    - Don't code yet, just understand
    - Focus on problems you attempted but didn't solve
    - Note any new techniques
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Upsolving Schedule

```
Day of contest: Read editorials only, no coding
Day after: Implement 1-2 unsolved problems
2 days after: Implement remaining problems

## <Icon icon="chart-line" /> Virtual Contest Protocol

### Making Virtuals Count

<Warning>
**Virtual contests MUST feel real to be useful.** Don't pause. Don't look up solutions. Don't extend time.
</Warning>

<img src="/images/courses/cp/virtual-vs-real.svg" alt="Virtual vs Real Contest" />

### Virtual Contest Rules

```
TREAT LIKE RATED:
✅ Same pre-contest routine
✅ Same 2-hour time limit (strict!)
✅ No looking anything up during
✅ Same post-contest analysis

THE BENEFIT:
- Practice under pressure without rating risk
- Experiment with different strategies
- Build endurance for 3-hour contests
```

### Ideal Virtual Contest Schedule
