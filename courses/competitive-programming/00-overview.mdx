# Competitive Programming Mastery

<img src="/images/courses/cp/cp-mastery-path.svg" alt="CP Mastery Path" />

> **This isn't just another algorithms course.** This is a strategic battle plan to take you from solving Div2A problems to crushing Div1 and qualifying for ICPC World Finals. Every chapter is designed with one goal: **make you win.**

<Info>
**Course Goal**: Take you from **Newbie (800)** to **Expert (1600+)** on Codeforces and prepare you for **ICPC Regionals** within 6-12 months of dedicated practice.
</Info>

## The Winning Formula

Most people practice CP wrong. They solve random problems, never upsolve, and wonder why they plateau. Here's the formula that actually works:

```
Rating Growth = Pattern Recognition × Problem Quantity × Upsolving × (1 / Random Solving)
```

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Pattern Recognition" icon="brain">
    80% of CF problems use just 15 core patterns. Master them and you'll "see" solutions instantly.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Strategic Practice" icon="chart-line">
    Solve problems slightly above your level. Use CP-31, Codeforces Problemset filters, and A2OJ ladders.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Upsolving is Everything" icon="rotate">
    Every problem you couldn't solve in contest is a lesson. Upsolve within 24 hours or you wasted the contest.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Speed + Accuracy" icon="bolt">
    In ICPC, solving 3 problems fast beats solving 4 problems slowly. Train for speed.

## The Strategic Approach

### The "See the Pattern" Framework

When you read a problem, run through this mental checklist:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Constraints Analysis (30 seconds)">
    - n ≤ 20 → Bitmask DP / Brute force
    - n ≤ 10³ → O(n²) solutions
    - n ≤ 10⁵ → O(n log n) or O(n)
    - n ≤ 10⁶ → O(n) only
  </Step>
  <Step title="Problem Type Recognition (1 minute)">
    - "Minimum/Maximum" → DP, Greedy, or Binary Search on Answer
    - "Count ways" → DP or Combinatorics
    - "Yes/No possible" → Greedy, Graph connectivity, or Binary Search
    - "Shortest path" → BFS/Dijkstra
    - "Subarray/Substring" → Two Pointers, Sliding Window, or Prefix Sum
  </Step>
  <Step title="Pattern Matching (2-3 minutes)">
    Match to known patterns. If stuck, think: "What's the simplest version of this problem I can solve?"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edge Cases (Before Coding)">
    n=1, n=2, all same elements, all different, sorted, reverse sorted, negative numbers.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## The Mindset of Champions

<Warning>
**Reading ≠ Learning. Solving ≠ Understanding.**

The only way to improve is:
1. **Struggle** with problems (at least 30-60 minutes before hints)
2. **Upsolve** everything you couldn't solve
3. **Analyze** why you got stuck
4. **Repeat** patterns until they're automatic
</Warning>

### Weekly Practice Schedule (Recommended)

| Day | Activity |
|-----|----------|
| Mon-Wed | Solve 3-5 problems/day from current topic |
| Thu | Virtual contest (past Div2) |
| Fri | Upsolve Thursday's contest |
| Sat | Live Codeforces contest |
| Sun | Upsolve + Review mistakes |
