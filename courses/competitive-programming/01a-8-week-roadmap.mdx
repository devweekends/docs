# 8-Week Roadmap: LeetCode to CF Specialist

## Who This Is For

You've solved LeetCode problems. You understand basic DSA. But Codeforces feels like a different universe—weird I/O, tight time limits, cryptic problem statements, and ratings that make no sense.

**This roadmap bridges that gap.**

<Note>
**Goal**: Reach **Specialist (1400+)** in 8 weeks, then **Expert (1600+)** in 3 more weeks.

**Prerequisites**: 
- Solved 100+ LeetCode problems (Easy/Medium)
- Know basic data structures (arrays, stacks, queues, trees)
- Understand Big O notation
- Can code in C++ (or willing to switch)
</Note>

## The LeetCode → Codeforces Gap

| Aspect | LeetCode | Codeforces |
|--------|----------|------------|
| **I/O** | Function signature given | Read from stdin, print to stdout |
| **Time Limit** | Generous (often 1-2s) | Tight (1-2s for 10^6 operations) |
| **Problem Style** | Clear, structured | Story-based, need to extract problem |
| **Test Cases** | Run before submit | Pretests only, system tests after |
| **Edge Cases** | Often handled | Will fail you brutally |
| **Speed** | Accuracy matters | Speed + Accuracy both matter |
| **Multiple Tests** | Usually single | Often T test cases in one run |
