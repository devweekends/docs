# Contest Strategy

## The Winning Mindset

Raw skill is not enough. The best competitive programmers combine technical knowledge with strategic thinking. This chapter covers the meta-skills that separate winners from participants.

<Note>
**The Three Pillars of Contest Success**:
1. **Speed**: Solve easy problems fast
2. **Accuracy**: Minimize wrong submissions
3. **Strategy**: Choose problems wisely
</Note>

## Understanding Contest Formats

### Codeforces Format

| Division | Rating Range | Problem Difficulty |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Div 3 | < 1600 | A: 800, B: 1000-1200, C: 1200-1400, D: 1400-1600 |
| Div 2 | < 2100 | A: 800-1000, B: 1200-1400, C: 1500-1700, D: 1800+ |
| Div 1 | 1900+ | A: 1700+, problems get very hard |

**Scoring**: Points decrease over time. Penalty for wrong submissions.

**Strategy by Rating**:
- 800-1200: Focus on solving A and B quickly
- 1200-1400: Solve A, B, C; attempt D
- 1400-1600: Solve A-D consistently; attempt E
- 1600+: Speed on A-C, deep thinking on D+

### ICPC Format

- **Team of 3, 1 computer**
- **5 hours, 10-13 problems**
- **Scoring**: Most problems solved, then fewest penalty minutes
- **No partial credit**: Solution must pass all test cases

**ICPC Strategy**:
- Assign problems by specialty (graphs, DP, math, etc.)
- One person reads while another codes
- Easy problems first to build momentum
- Keep one person thinking about hard problems

## The First 10 Minutes

These opening minutes can define your contest.

### Codeforces Routine

```
0:00 - Read Problem A
0:02 - Code and submit A
0:05 - Read Problem B
0:08 - Start coding B
```

<Warning>
**Don't lose rating on A and B!**
- Read carefully. Miss a constraint, lose 10 minutes.
- Check edge cases before submitting.
- If stuck for 5 minutes on A/B, you misread something.
</Warning>

### ICPC Routine

```
Member 1: Read A, B, C
Member 2: Read D, E, F
Member 3: Read G, H, I (or help with easier ones)

Immediately share: "A is easy [topic], B is [topic], etc."
```

---

## Reading Problems Effectively

### The 3-Read Method

1. **Skim** (30 seconds): What type of problem is this?
2. **Detailed Read** (2 minutes): Constraints, examples, edge cases
3. **Verification** (30 seconds): Reread the output format

### Constraint Analysis Cheat Sheet

| Constraint | Maximum Complexity | Typical Algorithm |
|------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| n ≤ 10 | O(n!) | Brute force, backtracking |
| n ≤ 20 | O(2^n) | Bitmask DP, meet in middle |
| n ≤ 100 | O(n³) | Floyd-Warshall, 3 nested loops |
| n ≤ 500 | O(n³) with optimization | Matrix DP |
| n ≤ 3000 | O(n²) | 2D DP, all pairs |
| n ≤ 10^5 | O(n log n) | Sorting, segment tree, binary search |
| n ≤ 10^6 | O(n) | Linear algorithms |
| n ≤ 10^9 | O(log n) or O(1) | Math, binary search on answer |

## When You're Stuck

### The 5-Minute Rule

If you've been stuck for 5 minutes:
1. **Reread the problem** - Did you miss something?
2. **Check examples manually** - Trace through by hand
3. **Try small cases** - n = 1, 2, 3
4. **Consider related patterns** - What technique does this remind you of?

### Escape Strategies

```
Stuck on implementation → Write pseudocode first
Stuck on approach → List all techniques that might apply
Stuck on edge cases → Think: 0, 1, -1, empty, maximum
Stuck on TLE → What's the bottleneck? Can you precompute?
```

### When to Skip

Skip a problem if:
- You've spent 20+ minutes with no progress
- The problem type is unfamiliar
- Easier problems remain unsolved

---

## Debugging Under Pressure

### Prevention is Better

```cpp
// Always use these before contest
#define int long long  // Prevent overflow bugs
const int INF = 1e18;  // Large enough for all cases

// Bounds check
assert(0 <= x && x < n);
```

### Stress Testing

```cpp
// Generate random test
void generateTest() {
    int n = rand() % 100 + 1;
    // Generate random input
}

// Compare brute force with optimized
while (true) {
    auto input = generateTest();
    auto ans1 = bruteForce(input);
    auto ans2 = optimized(input);
    if (ans1 != ans2) {
        // Print failing test
        break;
    }
}
```

### Common Bug Checklist

- Integer overflow (use `long long`)
- Array index out of bounds
- Uninitialized variables
- Off-by-one errors
- Wrong variable name (copy-paste errors)
- Forgetting to reset globals between test cases
- 0-indexing vs 1-indexing mismatch

---

## Time Management

### Codeforces Time Budget (2 hours)

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 0:00-0:15 | Solve A and B |
| 0:15-0:45 | Solve C |
| 0:45-1:15 | Solve D |
| 1:15-1:45 | Attempt E or revisit earlier problems |
| 1:45-2:00 | Clean up, submit what you have |

### Know When to Code vs Think

- **Code immediately**: You see the pattern clearly
- **Think first**: Novel problem, unclear approach
- **Switch problems**: Stuck 15+ minutes, others unsolved

---

## The CP-31 Checklist

Before submitting, verify:

1. **Input/Output** - Correct format? Flushed output?
2. **Edge cases** - n=0? n=1? Empty arrays?
3. **Overflow** - Need `long long`? Multiplication overflow?
4. **Constraints** - Does complexity fit time limit?
5. **Array bounds** - Enough space allocated?

---

## Post-Contest Analysis

### After Every Contest

1. **Upsolve unsolved problems** - This is where real learning happens
2. **Analyze time spent** - Where did you lose time?
3. **Review wrong submissions** - What caused them?
4. **Tag problems by pattern** - Build your pattern database

### Rating Goals and Practice

| Current Rating | Weekly Goal | Focus Areas |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| < 1200 | 5-10 problems | Implementation, basic math, greedy |
| 1200-1400 | 10-15 problems | Binary search, two pointers, basic DP |
| 1400-1600 | 10-15 problems | Graphs, harder DP, segment tree basics |
| 1600-1900 | 15-20 problems | Advanced data structures, number theory |

---

## Virtual Contests

Practice contests in real conditions.

```
Codeforces → Gym → Virtual Participation
Or
Past contests → Set 2-hour timer → No peeking at solutions
```

**Virtual Contest Rules**:
- No external resources (except template)
- No solution peeking
- Submit even if unsure
- Analyze performance afterward

---

## Building Your Template

A good template saves time and prevents bugs.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

#define int long long
#define endl '\n'
#define all(x) (x).begin(), (x).end()
#define sz(x) (int)(x).size()

const int INF = 1e18;
const int MOD = 1e9 + 7;

void solve() {
    // Your solution here
}

signed main() {
    ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(nullptr);
    
    int t = 1;
    cin >> t;  // Comment if single test
    
    while (t--) {
        solve();
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Psychology of Competition

### Staying Calm

- **Before contest**: Light practice, don't try new techniques
- **During contest**: One problem at a time, deep breaths
- **After WA**: Re-read problem, don't panic-submit

### Managing Tilt

When frustrated:
1. Take 30 seconds away from screen
2. Re-read problem from scratch
3. Ask: "What am I assuming that might be wrong?"

### The Growth Mindset

- Every contest teaches something
- Rating fluctuates—focus on learning
- Celebrate progress, not just wins

---

## ICPC-Specific Tips

### Team Coordination

```
Team Roles:
- Primary Coder: Best at typing/implementation
- Problem Picker: Reads all problems, decides order
- Specialist: Deep knowledge in specific areas

Communication:
- "I think A is [greedy/DP/graph]"
- "I need the computer in 5 minutes"
- "I'm stuck, can you look at this?"
```

### Coding Efficiency

- Print code for debugging
- One person codes, one reviews
- Use simple variable names for speed

---

## Codeforces-Specific Tips

### Rating Optimization

- **Don't oversubmit**: Penalty adds up
- **Lock early if confident**: Extra points for others' failures
- **Check hacks during freeze**: Learn from others' approaches

### Handling Pretests vs System Tests

- Pretests are NOT comprehensive
- Always consider edge cases
- Stress test if time permits

## Your 30-Day Improvement Plan

| 1 | Speed on A-B | 5 Div 2A + 5 Div 2B |
| 2 | C-level patterns | 5 Div 2C problems |
| 3 | D-level problems | 3 Div 2D problems |
| 4 | Full contests | 2 virtual contests + upsolving |
