# Upsolving & Reading Editorials

## What is Upsolving?

Upsolving = Solving problems you couldn't solve during a contest, after the contest ends.

**This is where 80% of your learning happens.**

<Note>
The contest shows you what you don't know. Upsolving teaches you what you need to know.
</Note>

---

## The Upsolving Process

### Step 1: Wait & Reset (5-10 minutes)

After a contest:
1. Take a break—clear your head
2. Don't read editorials immediately
3. Note which problems you attempted but failed

### Step 2: Second Attempt (20-30 minutes per problem)

Before reading the editorial:
1. Re-read the problem statement carefully
2. Check if you missed any constraint or condition
3. Think about the problem type (greedy? DP? graph?)
4. Try a different approach than during contest

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                  SECOND ATTEMPT                      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  1. Did I read the problem correctly?               │
│  2. What constraints did I miss?                    │
│  3. What approach makes sense for these bounds?     │
│  4. Can I simplify the problem?                     │
│  5. Are there any patterns I recognize?             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Step 3: Read the Editorial

If you're still stuck after 20-30 minutes, read the editorial.

**How to read an editorial effectively:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Read Only the First Hint">
    Most editorials have multiple levels. Read just the first observation or hint.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Close and Try Again">
    With that hint, attempt the problem again for 10-15 minutes.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Continue Reading If Stuck">
    Still stuck? Read the next part of the editorial.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Understand, Don't Memorize">
    Ask yourself: "Why does this work?" not "What's the code?"
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Step 4: Implement the Solution

Even if you understand the editorial, **code it yourself**.

```cpp
// Don't copy-paste from editorial
// Type it out, understand each line
// Add your own comments explaining the logic
```

### Step 5: Analyze the Key Insight

Write down the key insight in your own words:

```
Problem: [Problem Name]
Key Insight: [One sentence explaining the core trick]
Pattern: [What type of problem was this?]
Mistake: [What did I miss during contest?]
```

## Understanding CF Editorials

### Structure of a CF Editorial

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Problem A - [Title]                                │
│                                                     │
│  Time Complexity: O(n)                              │
│  Author: [Name]                                     │
│                                                     │
│  [Observations/Hints]                               │
│    Observation 1: ...                               │
│    Observation 2: ...                               │
│                                                     │
│  [Solution Approach]                                │
│    Step-by-step explanation                         │
│                                                     │
│  [Code]                                             │
│    Reference implementation                          │
│                                                     │
│  [Proof/Why It Works] (sometimes)                   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Reading Between the Lines

**Common Editorial Phrases & Their Meanings:**

| Editorial Says | What It Really Means |
|---------------|---------------------|
| "Observe that..." | This is the key insight you probably missed |
| "It's easy to see..." | It's not easy, but this is a standard technique |
| "Without loss of generality..." | You can simplify by assuming something |
| "Clearly..." | The author thinks it's obvious (it's not) |
| "Consider the optimal solution" | Think about what any correct answer must look like |
| "Greedy works because..." | There's a proof, but trust it for now |

## Upsolving Workflow

### Immediate Upsolve (Same Day)

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              CONTEST DAY SCHEDULE                   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Contest                     2 hours                │
│  Break                       30 min                 │
│  Second attempt (no editorial)  30-60 min          │
│  Read editorials + understand   30 min             │
│  Implement solutions            30-60 min          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Spaced Upsolving (1-7 Days Later)

Problems you've read editorials for:
1. Solve again from scratch (no looking)
2. If you can't, you didn't truly understand
3. Read editorial again if needed
4. Repeat until you can solve independently

## Building Your Problem Log

Create a structured log of every problem you upsolve:

### Template

```markdown
## Problem: [Link]
**Rating**: [800-3500]
**Tags**: [DP, Greedy, Graph, etc.]
**Date**: [When solved]
**Source**: [Div 2 C, Educational, etc.]

### Key Insight
[One sentence: the core trick or observation]

### Approach
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]

### My Mistake During Contest
[What went wrong / what I missed]

### Pattern Recognition
[What type of problem is this? What similar problems exist?]

### Code Snippet (if unique technique)
```cpp
// Key part of the solution
```
```

### Example Log Entry

```markdown
## Problem: CF 1873D - 1D Eraser
**Rating**: 1100
**Tags**: Greedy, Two Pointers
**Date**: 2024-01-15
**Source**: Div 4 D

### Key Insight
Greedily erase from left to right. When you hit a 'B', 
erase the next k characters and jump ahead.

### Approach
1. Scan left to right
2. When we see 'B', increment count, skip k characters
3. When we see 'W', just move to next character

### My Mistake During Contest
Overthought it. Tried to find "optimal" erasing positions.
Should have realized greedy from left works.

### Pattern Recognition
This is a "greedy scheduling" problem in disguise.
Similar to: interval covering, activity selection.
```

## Finding Editorials

### Where to Look

| Source | Quality | Speed |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Official CF Editorial | Best | Posted after contest |
| CF Comment Section | Variable | Sometimes faster |
| YouTube | Great for visual | Few hours after |
| USACO Guide | Excellent | Only for common problems |
| CP-Algorithms | Deep | Reference, not editorials |

### YouTube Channels for Upsolving

| Channel | Style | Best For |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Errichto | Detailed explanations | All levels |
| SecondThread | Contest reviews | Post-contest analysis |
| Colin Galen | In-depth tutorials | Advanced topics |
| William Lin | Speed solving | Learning techniques |
| Priyansh Agarwal | Hindi explanations | Hindi speakers |

## Common Upsolving Mistakes

<Warning>
**Mistake 1: Reading Editorial Too Soon**

Give yourself at least 20-30 minutes of genuine effort before reading.
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Mistake 2: Copy-Pasting Code**

Always type the solution yourself. Muscle memory matters.
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Mistake 3: Not Implementing After Reading**

Understanding ≠ Being able to code it. Always implement.
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Mistake 4: Moving On Too Quickly**

If you can't explain the solution to a friend, you don't understand it.
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Mistake 5: Never Revisiting**

Problems you upsolve should be solved again 3-7 days later.
</Warning>

---

## The Spaced Repetition System

### Rating-Based Intervals

| Problem Rating | First Revisit | Second Revisit | Third Revisit |
|---------------|---------------|----------------|---------------|
| At your level | 3 days | 7 days | 30 days |
| +100 above | 2 days | 5 days | 14 days |
| +200 above | 1 day | 3 days | 7 days |

### Tracking System

Create three lists:
1. **New**: Problems to upsolve
2. **Review**: Problems to revisit
3. **Mastered**: Problems you can solve reliably

Move problems through the pipeline as you master them.
