# Express.js Basics

In the previous chapters, you learned how to create a basic HTTP server using Node's built-in `http` module. While powerful, it requires significant boilerplate code for real-world applications. This is where **Express.js** comes in.

## The Problem with Raw HTTP

Using the built-in `http` module, even simple tasks become verbose:

```javascript
// Without Express - parsing JSON body manually
const http = require('http');

http.createServer((req, res) => {
  if (req.method === 'POST' && req.url === '/users') {
    let body = '';
    req.on('data', chunk => { body += chunk; });
    req.on('end', () => {
      const user = JSON.parse(body);
      res.writeHead(201, { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' });
      res.end(JSON.stringify(user));
    });
  }
}).listen(3000);
```

This gets even more complex when you add routing, error handling, authentication, and other features.

## Why Express.js?

**Express.js** is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. It's the **de facto standard** for Node.js web development.

### What Express Solves

| Problem | Express Solution |
|---------|------------------|
| Complex routing logic | Simple, declarative routing |
| Parsing request bodies | Built-in middleware |
| Managing middleware | Composable middleware chain |
| Error handling | Centralized error handlers |
| Serving static files | One-line configuration |

### Express by the Numbers

- **29+ million** weekly downloads on NPM
- Powers **thousands** of production applications
- Extensive ecosystem of middleware packages
- Battle-tested since 2010

## Installation

```bash
npm install express
```

## Creating a Basic Server

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const PORT = 5000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello from Express!');
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

## Routing

Express makes routing much easier than the raw `http` module.

```javascript
// GET request
app.get('/about', (req, res) => {
  res.send('About Page');
});

// POST request
app.post('/contact', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Contact Form Submitted');
});

// Dynamic Parameters
app.get('/users/:id', (req, res) => {
  res.send(`User ID: ${req.params.id}`);
});
```

## Middleware

Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (`req`), the response object (`res`), and the next middleware function in the application’s request-response cycle (`next`).

### Creating Custom Middleware

```javascript
const logger = (req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`${req.method} ${req.protocol}://${req.get('host')}${req.originalUrl}`);
  next(); // Call next middleware
};

// Initialize middleware
app.use(logger);
```

### Built-in Middleware

Express has built-in middleware for parsing body data.

```javascript
// Parse JSON bodies
app.use(express.json());

// Parse URL-encoded bodies (forms)
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false }));
```

## Serving Static Files

To serve static files such as images, CSS files, and JavaScript files, use the `express.static` built-in middleware function.

```javascript
const path = require('path');

// Set 'public' folder as static folder
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));
```

## Summary

- **Express.js** simplifies server creation and routing.
- Use `app.get()`, `app.post()`, etc., for routing.
- **Middleware** allows you to execute code between the request and response.
- `express.json()` is essential for parsing JSON data from requests.
- `express.static()` serves static assets easily.
