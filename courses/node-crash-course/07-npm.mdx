# NPM (Node Package Manager)

One of Node.js's greatest strengths is its ecosystem. Instead of writing everything from scratch, you can leverage hundreds of thousands of open-source packages built by developers worldwide. **NPM** (Node Package Manager) is the tool that makes this possible.

## Why Package Management Matters

Imagine building a web application and needing to:
- Parse JSON data
- Make HTTP requests
- Validate user input
- Hash passwords
- Connect to a database

You *could* write all this code yourself, but it would take months. Instead, you can install battle-tested packages that solve these problems in seconds.

### The Node.js Ecosystem

| Statistic | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Total packages on NPM | 2+ million |
| Weekly downloads | 30+ billion |
| Active developers | 17+ million |

This massive ecosystem means there's likely a package for almost any problem you're trying to solve.

## How NPM Works

NPM serves three main purposes:

1. **Registry**: A database of open-source packages anyone can publish to or download from
2. **CLI Tool**: A command-line tool (installed with Node.js) to install and manage packages
3. **Website**: [npmjs.com](https://npmjs.com) for discovering and learning about packages

<Tip>
NPM comes bundled with Node.js—if you have Node installed, you already have NPM. Check with `npm --version`.
</Tip>

## package.json

The `package.json` file is the manifest for your project. It keeps track of dependencies, scripts, version, and other metadata.

To create one, run:

```bash
npm init
# OR skip questions
npm init -y
```

## Installing Packages

### Local Installation

Installs the package in the `node_modules` folder of your current project.

```bash
npm install lodash
```

This adds `lodash` to the `dependencies` list in `package.json`.

### Dev Dependencies

Packages only needed for development (e.g., testing tools, linters).

```bash
npm install nodemon --save-dev
# OR
npm i -D nodemon
```

### Global Installation

Installs the package globally on your system (usually for CLI tools).

```bash
npm install -g nodemon
```

## Using Packages

Once installed, you can require them in your code.

```javascript
const _ = require('lodash');

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const reversed = _.reverse(numbers);
console.log(reversed);
```

## NPM Scripts

You can define custom scripts in `package.json`.

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "node app.js",
  "dev": "nodemon app.js",
  "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
}
```

Run them using:

```bash
npm run dev
npm start # Special shortcut, doesn't need 'run'
```

## Semantic Versioning (SemVer)

Versions are typically `Major.Minor.Patch` (e.g., `1.2.3`).

- **^1.2.3**: Updates to latest minor/patch version (e.g., 1.3.0, 1.2.4) but not 2.0.0.
- **~1.2.3**: Updates to latest patch version (e.g., 1.2.4) but not 1.3.0.
- **1.2.3**: Exact version.

## Summary

- **NPM** is the package manager for Node.js.
- **package.json** tracks dependencies and scripts.
- Use `npm install <package>` to add dependencies.
- Use `npm install -D <package>` for dev dependencies.
- **node_modules** folder contains the actual code of installed packages (never commit this to Git).
