# Introduction to Node.js

## What is Node.js?

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. It allows developers to use JavaScript to write command-line tools and for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser.

### Key Features

1.  **Asynchronous & Event-Driven**: All APIs of the Node.js library are asynchronous, that is, non-blocking. It essentially means a Node.js based server never waits for an API to return data. The server moves to the next API after calling it, and a notification mechanism of Events of Node.js helps the server to get a response from the previous API call.
2.  **Single-Threaded but Highly Scalable**: Node.js uses a single-threaded model with event looping. Event mechanism helps the server to respond in a non-blocking way and makes the server highly scalable as opposed to traditional servers which create limited threads to handle requests.
3.  **Fast Execution**: Being built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine, Node.js library is very fast in code execution.
4.  **No Buffering**: Node.js applications never buffer any data. These applications simply output the data in chunks.

## The V8 Engine

At the core of Node.js is the **V8 JavaScript engine**, the same engine that powers Google Chrome. V8 compiles JavaScript directly to native machine code before executing it, resulting in high performance.

## Installation

To get started, you need to install Node.js on your machine.

### Windows / macOS / Linux

1.  Visit the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).
2.  Download the **LTS (Long Term Support)** version. This version is recommended for most users as it's the most stable.
3.  Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.

### Verifying Installation

Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following commands:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

You should see the version numbers for both Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager).

## The REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop)

Node.js comes with a built-in REPL environment. It allows you to execute JavaScript code directly in the terminal.

To enter the REPL, simply type `node` in your terminal:

```bash
$ node
> console.log("Hello from Node.js!");
Hello from Node.js!
undefined
> 1 + 1
2
```

Press `Ctrl + C` twice to exit the REPL.

## Your First Node.js Script

Let's create a simple file to run with Node.js.

1.  Create a file named `app.js`.
2.  Add the following code:

```javascript
const message = "Hello, World!";
console.log(message);

const add = (a, b) => a + b;
console.log("2 + 3 =", add(2, 3));
```

3.  Run the file using the `node` command:

```bash
node app.js
```

**Output:**
```
Hello, World!
2 + 3 = 5
```

## Global Objects

In the browser, the global object is `window`. In Node.js, the global object is `global`.

```javascript
console.log(global);

// Common globals
console.log(__dirname); // Path to current directory
console.log(__filename); // Path to current file
```

Note that DOM-related objects like `document` or `window` do not exist in Node.js.

## Summary

In this chapter, we learned:
- What Node.js is and its key characteristics (Asynchronous, Single-threaded, V8 engine).
- How to install Node.js and verify the installation.
- How to use the REPL.
- How to write and run a simple Node.js script.
- The difference between the browser environment and Node.js (Global objects).
