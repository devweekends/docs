# JavaScript Crash Course

> **JavaScript** is the most ubiquitous programming language in the world. It runs in every browser, powers servers with Node.js, builds mobile apps, and even trains machine learning models. If you learn one language, make it JavaScript.

This crash course is designed to take you from "Hello World" to understanding closures, prototypes, async/await, and modern ES6+ features.

## Why JavaScript?

JavaScript has evolved from a simple scripting language to a versatile powerhouse.

    Objects, prototypal inheritance, and the `this` keyword.
    [Master Objects](/courses/javascript-crash-course/objects-prototypes)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Async JavaScript">
    Callbacks, Promises, async/await, and the Event Loop.

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming knowledge (any language).
- A modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
- Node.js installed for running JS outside the browser (`node -v`).
- A code editor (VS Code is highly recommended).

## The JavaScript Philosophy

> "Any application that can be written in JavaScript, will eventually be written in JavaScript." — Atwood's Law

JavaScript is a **multi-paradigm** language. You can write object-oriented, functional, or procedural code. It's **dynamically typed** (flexibility at the cost of runtime errors), and **single-threaded** with an **event-driven** architecture.

```javascript
// A taste of JavaScript
const greet = (name) => `Hello, ${name}!`;

const names = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'];

names
  .filter(name => name.startsWith('A'))
  .map(greet)
  .forEach(console.log);

// Output: "Hello, Alice!"
```
