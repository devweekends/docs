# Introduction to Linear Algebra for Machine Learning

Linear algebra is not just a mathematical tool—it's the **language** that machine learning speaks. Every image you classify, every recommendation you receive, every word a chatbot generates is powered by linear algebra operations happening millions of times per second.

## Why Linear Algebra for Machine Learning?

### The Data Representation Problem

Imagine you're building a system to recognize handwritten digits. How do you represent an image to a computer?

```python
# A 28x28 pixel grayscale image is just a matrix of numbers!
digit_image = [
    [0, 0, 0, 45, 123, 200, 255, ...],  # Row 1: 28 pixels
    [0, 0, 12, 89, 234, 255, 200, ...],  # Row 2: 28 pixels
    # ... 26 more rows
]

# Or flatten it into a vector
digit_vector = [0, 0, 0, 45, 123, 200, 255, 0, 0, 12, 89, ...]  # 784 numbers
```

**This is linear algebra**: representing complex data (images, text, audio) as vectors and matrices.

## What You'll Learn

### 1. Vectors: The Building Blocks

**What**: Numbers arranged in order  
**Why**: Every data point in ML is a vector  
**Example**: A house with 3 bedrooms, 2000 sqft, built in 1995 → `[3, 2000, 1995]`

**Real-World Applications**:
- **Image Search**: Find similar images by comparing their vector representations
- **Word Embeddings**: Words as vectors (king - man + woman ≈ queen)
- **Recommendation Systems**: Users and items as vectors in the same space

---

### 2. Matrices: Transformations and Operations

**What**: 2D arrays of numbers  
**Why**: Neural networks are just matrix multiplications stacked together  
**Example**: A neural network layer transforms input vector `x` to output `y = Wx + b`

**Real-World Applications**:
- **Image Filters**: Blurring, sharpening, edge detection (convolution = matrix operation)
- **Neural Networks**: Every layer is a matrix multiplication
- **Graph Analysis**: Social networks represented as adjacency matrices

---

### 3. Eigenvalues & Eigenvectors: Finding Patterns

**What**: Special vectors that don't change direction under transformation  
**Why**: They reveal the "principal directions" in your data  
**Example**: In face recognition, eigenfaces are the most important facial features

**Real-World Applications**:
- **PCA**: Reduce 1000 features to 10 while keeping 95% of information
- **Google PageRank**: Eigenvector of the web graph
- **Vibration Analysis**: Natural frequencies of structures

---

### 4. Matrix Decompositions: Breaking Down Complexity

**What**: Expressing a matrix as a product of simpler matrices  
**Why**: Reveals hidden structure, enables compression and denoising  
**Example**: SVD breaks an image into "layers" of importance

**Real-World Applications**:
- **Netflix Recommendations**: Matrix factorization (users × movies)
- **Image Compression**: JPEG uses similar techniques
- **Latent Semantic Analysis**: Understanding document topics

## How This Course Is Different

### 1. **Intuition First, Formulas Second**

We start with visual, geometric intuition:
- What does this operation **look like**?
- What does it **do** to data?
- **Why** would we want to do this?

Only then do we introduce the mathematical formulation.

### 2. **Real Data, Real Problems**

Every concept is demonstrated with:
- Real datasets (images, text, user ratings)
- Real ML applications (classification, regression, clustering)
- Real code you can run and modify

### 3. **Build From Scratch**

You'll implement key algorithms yourself:
- Matrix multiplication (understand the computational cost)
- PCA (see how dimensionality reduction works)
- SVD (build a recommendation system)

This builds deep understanding before using libraries.

### 4. **Visual Learning**

Custom diagrams for every major concept:
- Vector operations visualized in 2D/3D
- Matrix transformations shown geometrically
- Eigenvalues/eigenvectors animated
- Data projections illustrated
