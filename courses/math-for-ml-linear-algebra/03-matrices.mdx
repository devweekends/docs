# Matrices & Linear Transformations

## A Problem You Already Understand: Calculating Final Grades

You're a teacher with a spreadsheet of student data:

| Student | Homework (40%) | Midterm (25%) | Final (35%) |
|---------|---------------|---------------|-------------|
| Alice   | 92            | 88            | 85          |
| Bob     | 78            | 82            | 90          |
| Carol   | 95            | 90            | 92          |

**Question**: What's each student's final grade?

You already know how to do this in Excel:
```
=0.40*B2 + 0.25*C2 + 0.35*D2
```

For Alice: `0.40×92 + 0.25×88 + 0.35×85 = 36.8 + 22 + 29.75 = 88.55`

**Congratulations — you just did matrix multiplication!**

## What You Just Did (Mathematically)

Let's write that Excel formula as math:

![Matrix Transformation Math Concept](/images/courses/math-for-ml-linear-algebra/matrix-transformation-math.svg)

```python
import numpy as np

# Student scores as a vector
alice = np.array([92, 88, 85])  # [homework, midterm, final]

# Weights as a vector  
weights = np.array([0.40, 0.25, 0.35])

# Final grade = weighted sum
final_grade = np.dot(weights, alice)
# = 0.40×92 + 0.25×88 + 0.35×85
# = 88.55

print(f"Alice's grade: {final_grade:.1f}")
```

**The dot product IS the weighted sum.** You've been doing "matrix math" in Excel for years!

---

## Scaling Up: All Students at Once

What if you have 100 students? You don't want to calculate one by one.

```python
# All students in a matrix (each row = one student)
scores = np.array([
    [92, 88, 85],   # Alice
    [78, 82, 90],   # Bob  
    [95, 90, 92],   # Carol
])

# Weights
weights = np.array([0.40, 0.25, 0.35])

# Calculate ALL final grades at once!
final_grades = scores @ weights  # Matrix multiplication

print("Final grades:")
print(f"  Alice: {final_grades[0]:.1f}")
print(f"  Bob: {final_grades[1]:.1f}")
print(f"  Carol: {final_grades[2]:.1f}")
```

**Output:**
```
Final grades:
  Alice: 88.6
  Bob: 83.2
  Carol: 92.2
```

**That's matrix multiplication**: applying the same weighted sum to every row, all at once.

---

## What Is a Matrix?

Now let's get formal.

### A Matrix is a Table of Numbers

```python
# A 3×3 matrix (3 rows, 3 columns)
A = np.array([
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
])

print(A.shape)  # (3, 3)
```

### A Matrix is a Transformation Machine

Here's the key insight: **A matrix takes a vector in, and spits a different vector out.**

```
Input Vector  →  [Matrix]  →  Output Vector
   (3 numbers)               (could be different size!)
```

**Example**: Our grade calculation

```
[92, 88, 85]  →  [0.40, 0.25, 0.35]  →  88.55
   3 numbers         weights           1 number
```

The matrix (our weights) transformed 3 scores into 1 grade.

## Real-World Example: Photo Filters

Ever wonder how Instagram filters work? They're matrix operations!

![Photo Filter as Matrix Math](/images/courses/math-for-ml-linear-algebra/photo-filter-matrix.svg)

### Brightness: Multiply Every Pixel

```python
from PIL import Image
import numpy as np

# Load an image (each pixel is [R, G, B] from 0-255)
image = np.array(Image.open('photo.jpg'))
print(image.shape)  # e.g., (1080, 1920, 3) - height × width × RGB

# Increase brightness by 20%
brighter = image * 1.2
brighter = np.clip(brighter, 0, 255)  # Keep values in valid range

# That's scalar multiplication - a type of matrix operation!
```

### Color Transformation: Matrix Multiplication

What if you want to make a photo look "warmer" (more red/yellow) or "cooler" (more blue)?

```python
# A color transformation matrix
# Each row says how to calculate new [R, G, B] from old [R, G, B]
warm_filter = np.array([
    [1.2, 0.1, 0.0],   # New R = 1.2×R + 0.1×G + 0×B (boost red)
    [0.0, 1.1, 0.0],   # New G = 0×R + 1.1×G + 0×B (slight boost)
    [0.0, 0.0, 0.9],   # New B = 0×R + 0×G + 0.9×B (reduce blue)
])

# Apply to one pixel
original_pixel = np.array([100, 150, 200])  # Some blue-ish color
new_pixel = warm_filter @ original_pixel
print(f"Original: {original_pixel}")
print(f"Warmer: {new_pixel.astype(int)}")

# Output:
# Original: [100 150 200]
# Warmer: [135 165 180]  ← More red, less blue!
```

### Grayscale: Average the Colors

```python
# Grayscale transformation
# Human eyes are more sensitive to green, so we weight it higher
grayscale_weights = np.array([0.299, 0.587, 0.114])

pixel = np.array([100, 150, 200])
gray_value = np.dot(grayscale_weights, pixel)
print(f"Gray value: {gray_value:.0f}")  # 143
```

**Every Instagram filter is a matrix transformation on your pixels!**

## Real-World Example: Predicting House Prices

Now let's apply this to prediction — the core of machine learning.

### The Setup

You have data about houses:

| House | Bedrooms | Sqft | Age (years) | Price |
|-------|----------|------|-------------|-------|
| A     | 3        | 2000 | 10          | $350k |
| B     | 4        | 2500 | 5           | $450k |
| C     | 2        | 1200 | 20          | $250k |

**Question**: Given a NEW house with 3 bedrooms, 1800 sqft, 15 years old — what's the predicted price?

### The Approach: Weighted Sum of Features

Just like grades! Each feature contributes to the price:

```python
# New house features
new_house = np.array([3, 1800, 15])

# Weights (how much each feature matters)
# These would be "learned" from data in real ML
weights = np.array([
    50000,   # Each bedroom adds $50k
    150,     # Each sqft adds $150
    -3000,   # Each year of age subtracts $3k
])

# Prediction
predicted_price = np.dot(weights, new_house)
# = 50000×3 + 150×1800 + (-3000)×15
# = 150000 + 270000 - 45000
# = $375,000

print(f"Predicted price: ${predicted_price:,}")
```

### Predicting Many Houses at Once

```python
# Multiple houses
houses = np.array([
    [3, 2000, 10],   # House 1
    [4, 2500, 5],    # House 2
    [2, 1200, 20],   # House 3
    [3, 1800, 15],   # House 4 (our query)
])

# Predict ALL prices at once
prices = houses @ weights

print("Predicted prices:")
for i, price in enumerate(prices, 1):
    print(f"  House {i}: ${price:,}")
```

**Output:**
```
Predicted prices:
  House 1: $420,000
  House 2: $560,000
  House 3: $280,000
  House 4: $375,000
```

**This is linear regression** — and it's just matrix multiplication!

## The Connection to Machine Learning

Now you understand the core operation of ML. Let's make the connection explicit.

### What a Neural Network Layer Does

Every layer in a neural network does exactly what we just did:

```python
# Simplified neural network layer
def neural_network_layer(input_vector, weights, bias):
    """
    This is literally what PyTorch/TensorFlow do!
    """
    output = np.dot(weights, input_vector) + bias
    return output

# Example: 4 input features → 2 output neurons
input_features = np.array([3, 2000, 15, 5])  # House features

# Weight matrix: 2 outputs × 4 inputs
weights = np.array([
    [50000, 150, -3000, -5000],    # Weights for output 1
    [30000, 100, -2000, -3000],    # Weights for output 2
])

biases = np.array([10000, 5000])

# Forward pass
output = neural_network_layer(input_features, weights, biases)
print(f"Layer output: {output}")
# Two output values, computed by two different weighted sums
```

### The Pattern

| Application | Input | Weights | Output |
|-------------|-------|---------|--------|
| Grade calculation | [homework, midterm, final] | [0.4, 0.25, 0.35] | final_grade |
| House pricing | [beds, sqft, age] | [50k, 150, -3k] | price |
| Photo filter | [R, G, B] | 3×3 color matrix | [R', G', B'] |
| Neural network | features | learned weights | predictions |

**The math is identical. Only the application changes.**
final_grade = np.dot(weights, student)
# = (2.5×12) + (0.3×85) + (1.5×8) + (0.2×90)
# = 30 + 25.5 + 12 + 18
# = 85.5

print(f"Predicted final grade: {final_grade:.1f}")
```

### Batch Prediction for Entire Class

```python
# All students in class
students = np.array([
    [12, 85, 8, 90],   # Student A
    [8, 70, 6, 75],    # Student B
    [15, 95, 10, 95],  # Student C
])

# Predict all grades at once
grades = students @ weights
print(grades)  # [85.5, 63.5, 102.5]
```

**Real application**: Learning management systems use this to predict which students need help!

## Example 3: Movie Rating Prediction

### The Model

```python
# Movie features
movie = np.array([
    0.9,    # action score (0-1)
    0.1,    # romance score
    0.3,    # comedy score
    8.5,    # IMDb rating
    2020    # release year
])

# User preferences (weights)
user_weights = np.array([
    5,      # Loves action (+5 points)
    -2,     # Dislikes romance (-2 points)
    3,      # Likes comedy (+3 points)
    0.5,    # Considers IMDb rating
    -0.001  # Slight preference for newer movies
])

# Predict user's rating
predicted_rating = np.dot(user_weights, movie)
# = (5×0.9) + (-2×0.1) + (3×0.3) + (0.5×8.5) + (-0.001×2020)
# = 4.5 - 0.2 + 0.9 + 4.25 - 2.02
# = 7.43

print(f"Predicted rating: {predicted_rating:.1f}/10")
```

### Recommend Movies to User

```python
# Movie database
movies = np.array([
    [0.9, 0.1, 0.3, 8.5, 2020],  # Action movie
    [0.2, 0.9, 0.1, 7.5, 2019],  # Romance movie
    [0.7, 0.2, 0.8, 8.0, 2021],  # Action-comedy
])

# Predict ratings for all movies
ratings = movies @ user_weights
print(ratings)  # [7.43, 2.73, 8.88]

# Recommend highest-rated movie
best_movie = np.argmax(ratings)
print(f"Recommended: Movie {best_movie}")  # Movie 2 (action-comedy)
```

**Real application**: Netflix uses matrices to predict your ratings for millions of movies!

## Matrix Operations

### 1. Matrix Addition

**When to use**: Combining multiple models, updating parameters

```python
# Two prediction models
model_1 = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
model_2 = np.array([[5, 6], [7, 8]])

# Ensemble: average the models
ensemble = (model_1 + model_2) / 2
print(ensemble)
# [[3, 4],
#  [5, 6]]
```

### 2. Scalar Multiplication

**When to use**: Scaling predictions, learning rates

```python
# Original weights
weights = np.array([[50000, 120, -5000, -8000]])

# Scale down for regularization
scaled_weights = 0.9 * weights
```

### 3. Matrix Multiplication

**The Most Important Operation!**

**Rule**: (m×n) matrix × (n×p) matrix = (m×p) matrix

The **inner dimensions must match**!

```python
# Example: Neural network layer
# Input: 3 features → Output: 2 neurons

# Weight matrix (2 neurons × 3 features)
W = np.array([
    [0.5, -0.3, 0.8],  # Weights for neuron 1
    [0.2, 0.6, -0.4]   # Weights for neuron 2
])

# Input vector (3 features)
x = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])

# Output (2 neurons)
y = W @ x
# Neuron 1: (0.5×1.0) + (-0.3×2.0) + (0.8×3.0) = 2.3
# Neuron 2: (0.2×1.0) + (0.6×2.0) + (-0.4×3.0) = 0.2

print(y)  # [2.3, 0.2]
```

![Neural Network Layer](/images/courses/math-for-ml-linear-algebra/neural-network-layer.svg)

**Key Insight**: Every neural network layer is just matrix multiplication!

## Matrix Multiplication: Three Examples

### Example 1: Multi-Output House Prediction

Predict **multiple** outputs from house features:

```python
# House features
house = np.array([3, 2000, 15, 5])

# Weight matrix (3 outputs × 4 features)
W = np.array([
    [50000, 120, -5000, -8000],   # Price prediction
    [0.8, 0.0002, -0.01, -0.02],  # Desirability score (0-1)
    [2, 0.001, -0.5, -0.3]        # Market time (months)
])

# Predict all outputs
outputs = W @ house
print(f"Price: ${outputs[0]:,.0f}")
print(f"Desirability: {outputs[1]:.2f}")
print(f"Time to sell: {outputs[2]:.1f} months")
```

**Output**:
```
Price: $275,000
Desirability: 0.73
Time to sell: 2.8 months
```

### Example 2: Student Performance Across Subjects

Predict grades in multiple subjects:

```python
# Student features
student = np.array([12, 85, 8, 90])  # [study_hours, prev_score, assignments, attendance]

# Weight matrix (3 subjects × 4 features)
W = np.array([
    [2.5, 0.3, 1.5, 0.2],   # Math
    [2.0, 0.4, 1.0, 0.3],   # English
    [3.0, 0.2, 2.0, 0.1]    # Science
])

# Predict all subject grades
grades = W @ student
print(f"Math: {grades[0]:.1f}")
print(f"English: {grades[1]:.1f}")
print(f"Science: {grades[2]:.1f}")
```

### Example 3: Multi-User Movie Recommendations

Predict ratings for multiple users:

```python
# Movie features
movie = np.array([0.9, 0.1, 0.3, 8.5, 2020])

# User preference matrix (3 users × 5 features)
U = np.array([
    [5, -2, 3, 0.5, -0.001],    # User 1: loves action
    [-1, 5, 2, 0.3, -0.002],    # User 2: loves romance
    [3, 1, 4, 0.4, 0]           # User 3: balanced
])

# Predict ratings for all users
ratings = U @ movie
print(f"User 1 rating: {ratings[0]:.1f}")
print(f"User 2 rating: {ratings[1]:.1f}")
print(f"User 3 rating: {ratings[2]:.1f}")
```

---

## Matrix Transpose

**Definition**: Flip rows and columns

```python
A = np.array([
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6]
])

A_T = A.T
print(A_T)
# [[1, 4],
#  [2, 5],
#  [3, 6]]
```

**Why it matters**: Used in backpropagation!

```python
# Forward pass
X = np.array([[1, 2, 3]])  # (1×3) input
W = np.array([[0.5], [0.3], [0.8]])  # (3×1) weights
y = X @ W  # (1×1) output

# Backward pass (gradient)
dy = np.array([[1.0]])  # Gradient from loss
dW = X.T @ dy  # (3×1) gradient for weights
```

---

## Identity Matrix

**Definition**: Matrix that doesn't change vectors

$$
I\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{v}
$$

```python
I = np.eye(3)  # 3×3 identity
print(I)
# [[1, 0, 0],
#  [0, 1, 0],
#  [0, 0, 1]]

v = np.array([5, 10, 15])
result = I @ v
print(result)  # [5, 10, 15] (unchanged!)
```

**Why it matters**: Used in regularization, initialization, and matrix inversion.

---

## Matrix Inverse

**Definition**: Matrix that "undoes" another matrix

$$
A A^{-1} = I
$$

```python
A = np.array([
    [4, 7],
    [2, 6]
])

A_inv = np.linalg.inv(A)
print(A_inv)

# Verify
print(A @ A_inv)  # ≈ Identity matrix
```

**Application**: Solving linear equations

```python
# Solve: Ax = b for x
A = np.array([[2, 1], [1, 3]])
b = np.array([5, 7])

# Solution: x = A^(-1) b
x = np.linalg.inv(A) @ b
print(x)  # [1, 3]

# Verify
print(A @ x)  # [5, 7] ✓
```

### Exercise 1: Instagram Color Filters 📸

Create custom photo filters using matrix transformations:

```python
import numpy as np

# A pixel is represented as [R, G, B] from 0-255
sample_pixel = np.array([180, 120, 90])  # A warm skin tone

# TODO: Create these filter matrices and apply them
# 1. Sepia filter (vintage brown look)
# 2. Negative filter (invert colors)
# 3. Custom "sunset" filter (boost reds/oranges)
```

**Tasks**:
1. Design a 3×3 sepia transformation matrix
2. Apply it to the sample pixel
3. Create your own artistic filter

<Accordion title="💡 Solution">
```python
import numpy as np

sample_pixel = np.array([180, 120, 90])

# 1. Sepia Filter Matrix (classic vintage look)
sepia = np.array([
    [0.393, 0.769, 0.189],  # New R
    [0.349, 0.686, 0.168],  # New G
    [0.272, 0.534, 0.131],  # New B
])

# 2. Negative Filter (invert)
negative = np.array([
    [-1, 0, 0],
    [0, -1, 0],
    [0, 0, -1],
])

# 3. Sunset Filter (warm, golden hour look)
sunset = np.array([
    [1.2, 0.1, 0.0],   # Boost red
    [0.1, 1.0, 0.0],   # Slight red bleed to green
    [0.0, 0.0, 0.7],   # Reduce blue
])

print("Original pixel:", sample_pixel)
print("-" * 40)

# Apply Sepia
sepia_result = np.clip(sepia @ sample_pixel, 0, 255).astype(int)
print(f"Sepia filter:   {sepia_result}")

# Apply Negative (add 255 to invert)
negative_result = np.clip(negative @ sample_pixel + 255, 0, 255).astype(int)
print(f"Negative:       {negative_result}")

# Apply Sunset
sunset_result = np.clip(sunset @ sample_pixel, 0, 255).astype(int)
print(f"Sunset filter:  {sunset_result}")

# Output:
# Original pixel: [180 120  90]
# Sepia filter:   [196 174 136]  ← Warm vintage brown
# Negative:       [ 75 135 165]  ← Inverted colors
# Sunset filter:  [228 138  63]  ← Golden warm tones
```

**Real-World Insight**: Instagram's filters are exactly this - matrix multiplications applied to every pixel! The "Clarendon" filter boosts contrast, "Gingham" adds vintage fade.

### Exercise 2: Multi-Store Inventory Management 🏪

A retail company has 3 stores and 4 products. Calculate total revenue using matrix multiplication:

```python
# Inventory: rows = stores, cols = products
inventory = np.array([
    [50, 30, 100, 25],   # Store A
    [80, 45, 60, 40],    # Store B
    [35, 60, 80, 55],    # Store C
])

# Prices per product
prices = np.array([29.99, 49.99, 9.99, 79.99])

# Units sold (percentage of inventory)
sales_rate = np.array([
    [0.8, 0.6, 0.9, 0.5],   # Store A
    [0.7, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6],   # Store B
    [0.9, 0.5, 0.8, 0.7],   # Store C
])
```

**Tasks**:
1. Calculate units sold at each store (element-wise multiply inventory × sales_rate)
2. Calculate total revenue per store (matrix × price vector)
3. Which store had the highest revenue?

<Accordion title="💡 Solution">
```python
import numpy as np

inventory = np.array([
    [50, 30, 100, 25],   # Store A
    [80, 45, 60, 40],    # Store B
    [35, 60, 80, 55],    # Store C
])

prices = np.array([29.99, 49.99, 9.99, 79.99])

sales_rate = np.array([
    [0.8, 0.6, 0.9, 0.5],
    [0.7, 0.8, 0.7, 0.6],
    [0.9, 0.5, 0.8, 0.7],
])

# 1. Units sold at each store (element-wise)
units_sold = inventory * sales_rate
print("Units Sold per Store:")
print(units_sold)

# 2. Revenue per store (matrix-vector multiplication)
revenue_per_store = units_sold @ prices
print("\n💰 Revenue per Store:")
stores = ['Store A', 'Store B', 'Store C']
for store, rev in zip(stores, revenue_per_store):
    print(f"  {store}: ${rev:,.2f}")

# 3. Best performing store
best_store = stores[np.argmax(revenue_per_store)]
print(f"\n🏆 Highest Revenue: {best_store} (${max(revenue_per_store):,.2f})")

# Output:
# Revenue per Store:
#   Store A: $3,288.35
#   Store B: $4,275.18  ← Winner!
#   Store C: $4,270.63

# Bonus: Revenue breakdown by product
print("\n📊 Revenue by Product (all stores):")
product_revenue = units_sold.sum(axis=0) * prices
products = ['Product 1', 'Product 2', 'Product 3', 'Product 4']
for prod, rev in zip(products, product_revenue):
    print(f"  {prod}: ${rev:,.2f}")

### Exercise 3: Simple Neural Network Forward Pass 🧠

Implement a tiny neural network using only matrix operations:

```python
import numpy as np

# Input: 4 features (e.g., house: beds, baths, sqft/1000, age/10)
X = np.array([[3, 2, 1.5, 1.5]])  # 1 house

# Layer 1: 4 inputs → 3 neurons
W1 = np.array([
    [0.5, 0.3, 0.8, -0.2],
    [0.2, 0.6, 0.4, -0.1],
    [0.7, 0.1, 0.5, -0.3],
])
b1 = np.array([0.1, 0.2, 0.1])

# Layer 2: 3 neurons → 1 output (price)
W2 = np.array([[0.8, 0.5, 0.6]])
b2 = np.array([0.1])
```

**Tasks**:
1. Compute the output of Layer 1: `h = X @ W1.T + b1`
2. Apply ReLU activation: `h = max(0, h)`
3. Compute final output: `y = h @ W2.T + b2`
4. What's the predicted price?

<Accordion title="💡 Solution">
```python
import numpy as np

# Input
X = np.array([[3, 2, 1.5, 1.5]])

# Layer 1 weights and bias
W1 = np.array([
    [0.5, 0.3, 0.8, -0.2],
    [0.2, 0.6, 0.4, -0.1],
    [0.7, 0.1, 0.5, -0.3],
])
b1 = np.array([0.1, 0.2, 0.1])

# Layer 2 weights and bias
W2 = np.array([[0.8, 0.5, 0.6]])
b2 = np.array([0.1])

def relu(x):
    return np.maximum(0, x)

# Forward pass
print("🧠 Neural Network Forward Pass")
print("=" * 40)

# Layer 1
z1 = X @ W1.T + b1
print(f"Layer 1 pre-activation (z1): {z1}")

h1 = relu(z1)
print(f"Layer 1 post-ReLU (h1):      {h1}")

# Layer 2 (output)
z2 = h1 @ W2.T + b2
print(f"\nFinal output (z2): {z2}")

# Interpret as price (scale back)
predicted_price = z2[0, 0] * 100000  # Scale factor
print(f"\n🏠 Predicted House Price: ${predicted_price:,.0f}")

# Output:
# Layer 1 pre-activation: [[3.4  2.55 3.3 ]]
# Layer 1 post-ReLU:      [[3.4  2.55 3.3 ]]
# Final output: [[5.095]]
# Predicted House Price: $509,500
```

**Real-World Insight**: This is EXACTLY how PyTorch and TensorFlow work under the hood! Every deep learning model is just chains of matrix multiplications with non-linear activations.

### Exercise 4: Cryptography - Hill Cipher 🔐

The Hill Cipher uses matrix multiplication to encrypt messages:

```python
import numpy as np

# Encryption key (2x2 matrix)
key = np.array([
    [3, 3],
    [2, 5]
])

# Message: "HI" → Convert to numbers (A=0, B=1, ... Z=25)
# H=7, I=8
message = np.array([[7], [8]])

# Encrypt: ciphertext = key @ message (mod 26)
```

**Tasks**:
1. Encrypt the message "HI"
2. Find the decryption key (matrix inverse mod 26)
3. Decrypt back to the original message

<Accordion title="💡 Solution">
```python
import numpy as np

def mod_inverse(a, m):
    """Find modular multiplicative inverse of a mod m"""
    for x in range(1, m):
        if (a * x) % m == 1:
            return x
    return None

# Encryption key
key = np.array([
    [3, 3],
    [2, 5]
])

# Message: "HI"
message = np.array([[7], [8]])  # H=7, I=8
print(f"Original message: HI → {message.flatten()}")

# 1. ENCRYPT
ciphertext = (key @ message) % 26
print(f"Encrypted: {ciphertext.flatten()}")

# Convert back to letters
cipher_letters = ''.join([chr(c + ord('A')) for c in ciphertext.flatten()])
print(f"Ciphertext letters: {cipher_letters}")

# 2. FIND DECRYPTION KEY
# Key inverse (mod 26) = (1/det) * adjugate (mod 26)
det = int(np.linalg.det(key)) % 26  # det = 3*5 - 3*2 = 9
det_inv = mod_inverse(det, 26)  # 9^(-1) mod 26 = 3

# Adjugate matrix
adjugate = np.array([
    [5, -3],
    [-2, 3]
])

# Decryption key
key_inv = (det_inv * adjugate) % 26
print(f"\nDecryption key:\n{key_inv}")

# 3. DECRYPT
decrypted = (key_inv @ ciphertext) % 26
print(f"\nDecrypted: {decrypted.flatten()}")

# Convert back to letters
original = ''.join([chr(int(c) + ord('A')) for c in decrypted.flatten()])
print(f"Original message: {original}")

# Output:
# Original message: HI → [7 8]
# Encrypted: [19 2]
# Ciphertext letters: TC
# Decryption key: [[15 17] [20  9]]
# Decrypted: [[7] [8]]
# Original message: HI ✓
```

**Real-World Insight**: While Hill Cipher is breakable, modern encryption (RSA, AES) uses similar matrix operations in much larger spaces. Your HTTPS connection uses these principles!
