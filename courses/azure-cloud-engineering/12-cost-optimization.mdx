## Introduction: The Cloud Cost Crisis (Start Here if You're New)

### The $50,000 Surprise Bill (True Story)

**Scenario**: Small startup with 10 employees

```
Month 1: Azure bill = $500
  ↓ "Looks reasonable!"
  ↓
Month 2: Azure bill = $2,000
  ↓ "We launched new features, makes sense"
  ↓
Month 3: Azure bill = $8,000
  ↓ "Uh oh..."
  ↓
Month 4: Azure bill = $50,000 ❌
  ↓ CEO: "WE'RE GOING BANKRUPT!"
```

**What happened?**
- Developer left 20 VMs running for testing (forgot to shut them down)
- Autoscaling set to create unlimited VMs (no budget limit)
- Storage set to Hot tier for all data (including old logs)
- Network traffic exploded (no CDN, serving 100 TB/month from Azure directly)
- No monitoring, no alerts, no cost tracking

**Cost breakdown (Month 4)**:
- 20 test VMs @ $200/month = $4,000/month
- 50 autoscaled production VMs @ $300/month = $15,000/month
- 200 TB storage (Hot tier) @ $37/TB = $7,400/month
- 100 TB network egress @ $87/TB = $8,700/month
- Cosmos DB (50,000 RU/s always on) = $4,800/month
- Azure SQL (Premium tier, unused) = $3,000/month
- Misc (snapshots, disks, load balancers) = $7,100/month

**Total: $50,000/month** for a startup with 1,000 users!

**The fix (took 1 week)**:
- Auto-shutdown test VMs at night → Saved $2,400/month (60% savings)
- Right-sized production VMs → Saved $6,000/month
- Moved old data to Archive tier → Saved $6,500/month
- Added Azure Front Door CDN → Saved $7,000/month
- Cosmos DB autoscale → Saved $2,500/month
- Deleted unused resources → Saved $10,000/month

**New monthly cost: $15,600/month (69% savings!)**

### Why Cloud Costs Are Hard to Control

**Cloud vs. Traditional Data Center**:

**Traditional Data Center** (CapEx model):
```
Buy 10 servers upfront: $100,000
  ↓ Pay once
  ↓ Use for 3 years
  ↓ Total cost: $100,000 (fixed, predictable)
  ↓ Cost per month: $2,778
  ↓ No surprises ✅
```

**Cloud** (OpEx model):
```
Spin up 10 VMs: $0 upfront
  ↓ Pay per second of usage
  ↓ Developer creates 50 more VMs for testing
  ↓ Autoscaling creates 100 more VMs during spike
  ↓ Someone leaves VM running over weekend
  ↓ Total cost: Unpredictable! ❌
  ↓ Can range from $1,000 to $100,000/month
```

**The Problem**:
- **Easy to spend**: Spinning up resources takes 5 minutes, costs happen instantly
- **Hard to track**: Bills come 30 days later (you forget what you created)
- **Invisible waste**: Unused resources keep billing you (forgotten VMs, orphaned disks)
- **Complex pricing**: 1,000+ pricing variables (VM sizes, storage tiers, network egress, etc.)

---

### Real-World Cost Horror Stories

**Example 1: The $72,000 Test Environment**

**What happened**:
- QA team created test environment for Black Friday load testing
- Used production-sized VMs (50 Standard_D16s_v3 VMs)
- Ran load test for 2 days
- **Forgot to delete test environment**
- Test VMs ran for 6 months

**Cost**:
- 50 VMs × $600/month × 6 months = $180,000
- Should have cost: 50 VMs × $600/month × 0.07 months (2 days) = $2,100
- Waste: $177,900

**Prevention**:
- Auto-delete policy: Delete all resources tagged "Test" after 7 days
- Cost: $0 (built-in Azure feature)

---

**Example 2: The $200,000 CDN Bill**

**What happened**:
- E-commerce site serves product images directly from Azure Storage
- No CDN (Content Delivery Network)
- 500 TB/month of network egress

**Cost**:
- Network egress: 500 TB × $87/TB = $43,500/month
- Storage: 10 TB × $18/TB = $180/month
- **Total: $43,680/month**

**Fix** (Added Azure Front Door CDN):
- CDN cache hit rate: 95%
- Network egress from Azure: 25 TB (95% served from CDN cache)
- 25 TB × $87/TB = $2,175/month
- CDN cost: $2,000/month
- **Total: $4,175/month (90% savings!)**

**Savings: $39,505/month**

---

**Example 3: The "Stopped" VM That Kept Billing**

**What happened**:
- Developer "stopped" 20 VMs thinking it would save money
- VMs showed as "Stopped" in Azure Portal
- Still got charged $4,000/month

**Why?**
- VMs were "Stopped" (shutdown OS) but NOT "Deallocated"
- Azure still reserved the hardware (CPU, RAM)
- Still charging compute costs

**Fix**:
```bash
# Wrong: Just shutting down OS (still charges!)
Stop-VM -Name "my-vm"

# Correct: Deallocate VM (stops compute charges)
Stop-AzVM -Name "my-vm" -ResourceGroupName "rg-prod" -Force
```

**Savings: $4,000/month**

### Understanding Azure Pricing (Simple Explanation)

**Azure has 3 main cost categories**:

**1. Compute (Running things)**
- **What**: Cost to run VMs, App Services, Functions, Containers
- **How charged**: Per second/minute/hour
- **Analogy**: Renting a car (pay per hour you use it)
- **Example**: Standard_D2s_v3 VM = $0.096/hour = $70/month (if running 24/7)

**2. Storage (Storing things)**
- **What**: Cost to store data (disks, blobs, databases)
- **How charged**: Per GB stored per month + operations (read/write)
- **Analogy**: Renting a storage unit (pay per square foot per month)
- **Example**: 1 TB Blob Storage (Hot tier) = $18/month

**3. Network (Moving things)**
- **What**: Cost to transfer data in/out of Azure
- **How charged**: Per GB transferred
- **Analogy**: Shipping packages (pay per pound shipped)
- **Example**: 100 GB egress = $8.70

---

### The Hidden Costs Nobody Tells You About

**1. Stopped VMs still cost money** (if not deallocated)
- VM stopped (OS shutdown): Still charges compute ❌
- VM deallocated: Compute stops, only storage charged ✅

**2. Unattached disks keep billing**
- Deleted VM, but disk still exists: $100/month waste
- Fix: Delete disks when deleting VMs

**3. Snapshots are not free**
- 10 snapshots × 100 GB × $0.05/GB = $50/month
- Fix: Delete old snapshots after 30 days

**4. Public IP addresses cost money**
- Static public IP: $3.50/month (even if not attached to anything)
- Unattached public IPs: Common waste

**5. Load balancers without backends**
- Empty load balancer: $20/month
- Fix: Delete unused load balancers

**6. Database backups**
- Automatic backups for Azure SQL: Included
- Keeping backups > 35 days: Extra cost ($0.20/GB/month)

---

**What is Cost Optimization?** Cost optimization is the practice of reducing cloud spending while maintaining or improving performance. It's not about being cheap—it's about spending wisely and eliminating waste.

**Why It Matters**:
- **The Problem**: Cloud bills can spiral out of control. A $1,000/month bill can become $10,000/month if not monitored.
- **The Solution**: Understand what you're paying for, eliminate waste, and optimize resources.

**Real-World Example**:
- **Before Optimization**: Company spends $50,000/month on Azure
  - 50 VMs running 24/7 (even at night)
  - Oversized VMs (using 10% CPU but paying for 100%)
  - Unused resources (old disks, snapshots)
  - No reservations (paying full price)
- **After Optimization**: Company spends $20,000/month (60% savings!)
  - Auto-shutdown for dev/test VMs
  - Right-sized VMs
  - Deleted unused resources
  - Purchased 3-year reservations

## Understanding Azure Pricing

**How Azure Charges You**: Azure uses a **pay-as-you-go** model. You pay for what you use, billed per second/minute/hour.

**Key Concepts**:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Compute Charges">
    **What**: Charges for running VMs, App Services, Functions
    
    **How It Works**:
    - VM running = charged per second
    - VM stopped (deallocated) = no compute charge (storage still charged)
    - VM stopped (not deallocated) = still charged (reserves hardware)
    
    **Example**:
    ```
    Standard_D2s_v3 VM:
    - Running: $0.096/hour = $70/month (if running 24/7)
    - Stopped (deallocated): $0/month compute, $10/month storage
    - Stopped (not deallocated): $70/month (still reserves hardware!)
    ```
    
    **Gotcha**: Just shutting down the OS doesn't stop charges. You must **deallocate** the VM.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Storage Charges">
    **What**: Charges for storing data (disks, blobs, databases)
    
    **How It Works**:
    - Charged per GB stored
    - Different tiers cost different amounts (Hot > Cool > Archive)
    - Operations (reads/writes) also cost money
    
    **Example**:
    ```
    1 TB Blob Storage:
    - Hot tier: $18.40/month
    - Cool tier: $10/month (44% savings)
    - Archive tier: $0.99/month (95% savings!)
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Network Charges">
    **What**: Charges for data transfer (egress)
    
    **How It Works**:
    - Data IN to Azure: Free
    - Data OUT of Azure: Charged per GB
    - First 5 GB/month: Free
    - After that: $0.05-0.12 per GB (varies by region)
    
    **Example**:
    ```
    Website serving 100 GB/month:
    - First 5 GB: Free
    - Remaining 95 GB: $9.50/month (at $0.10/GB)
    ```
    
    **Gotcha**: CDN (Azure Front Door) can reduce egress costs by caching content at the edge.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Reserved Instances">
    **What**: Pre-pay for 1-3 years, get 30-70% discount
    
    **How It Works**:
    - Commit to using a VM size for 1 or 3 years
    - Pay upfront or monthly
    - Get discount on compute charges
    
    **Example**:
    ```
    Standard_D2s_v3 VM:
    - Pay-as-you-go: $70/month
    - 1-year reservation: $42/month (40% savings)
    - 3-year reservation: $28/month (60% savings)
    ```
    
    **When to Use**: Stable, long-running workloads (production databases, always-on services)

> [!WARNING]
> **Gotcha: B-Series Credits**
> "Burstable" (B-series) VMs are cheap because they limit your CPU. If you use 100% CPU for too long, you run out of "credits" and your VM gets throttled to 10% speed. Monitor your `CPUCreditsRemaining` metric!

> [!TIP]
> **Jargon Alert: Amortization**
> If you pay $3,600 upfront for a 3-year reservation, "Amortized Cost" shows it as $100/month in your reports. This helps you track the *effective* monthly burn rate, not just the cash flow.

## 5. FinOps Framework

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/azure/12-finops-lifecycle.svg" alt="FinOps Lifecycle: Inform, Optimize, Operate" />
</Frame>


**FinOps** (Financial Operations) = Cultural practice bringing financial accountability to cloud spending.

### FinOps Principles

1. **Teams need to collaborate**: Finance, Engineering, Product work together
2. **Everyone takes ownership**: Engineers see cost impact of their decisions
3. **Centralized team drives FinOps**: Dedicated FinOps team enables best practices
4. **Reports should be accessible**: Real-time cost visibility for all stakeholders
5. **Decisions are driven by business value**: Cost vs performance tradeoffs
6. **Take advantage of variable cost model**: Right-size continuously

### FinOps Lifecycle

```
┌─────────────┐
│   INFORM    │  ← Visibility, allocation, benchmarking
└──────┬──────┘
       ↓
┌─────────────┐
│  OPTIMIZE   │  ← Right-sizing, reservations, waste removal
└──────┬──────┘
       ↓
┌─────────────┐
│  OPERATE    │  ← Continuous improvement, automation
└─────────────┘
```

### Implementing FinOps

**Phase 1: Visibility (Month 1-2)**
```bash
# 1. Enable Cost Management
az costmanagement export create \
  --name daily-costs \
  --type ActualCost \
  --schedule-recurrence Daily \
  --storage-account-id /subscriptions/.../storageAccounts/costs

# 2. Tag all resources
az tag create --resource-id $RESOURCE_ID \
  --tags Environment=Production Team=Platform CostCenter=Engineering

# 3. Create cost alerts
az consumption budget create \
  --budget-name monthly-budget \
  --amount 10000 \
  --time-grain Monthly \
  --start-date 2026-01-01 \
  --end-date 2026-12-31
```

**Phase 2: Accountability (Month 3-4)**
- Assign cost owners to each resource group
- Create showback reports per team
- Monthly cost review meetings

**Phase 3: Optimization (Month 5+)**
- Implement right-sizing recommendations
- Purchase reserved instances for base load
- Automate waste removal

---

## 6. Tagging Strategy & Governance

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/azure/12-cost-allocation-tags.svg" alt="Cost Allocation through Tagging Strategy" />
</Frame>


**Tags** = Metadata for cost allocation, automation, and governance.

### Essential Tags

| Tag | Example | Purpose |
|-----|---------|---------|
| **Environment** | Production, Dev, Staging | Separate costs by environment |
| **CostCenter** | Engineering, Marketing | Chargeback to departments |
| **Owner** | john@company.com | Accountability |
| **Project** | ProjectAlpha, Migration2026 | Track project costs |
| **Application** | WebApp, API, Database | Group related resources |
| **Criticality** | Critical, High, Medium, Low | Prioritize optimization |

### Tag Governance with Azure Policy

**Require tags on all resources**:
```json
{
  "if": {
    "allOf": [
      {
        "field": "type",
        "equals": "Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines"
      },
      {
        "field": "tags['Environment']",
        "exists": "false"
      }
    ]
  },
  "then": {
    "effect": "deny"
  }
}
```

### Bulk Tagging Script

```powershell
# Tag all VMs in a resource group
$rg = "rg-production"
$tags = @{
    Environment = "Production"
    CostCenter = "Engineering"
    Owner = "platform-team@company.com"
}

Get-AzResource -ResourceGroupName $rg | ForEach-Object {
    $resource = $_
    $resourceTags = $resource.Tags
    
    # Merge tags (don't overwrite existing)
    foreach ($key in $tags.Keys) {
        if (-not $resourceTags.ContainsKey($key)) {
            $resourceTags[$key] = $tags[$key]
        }
    }
    
    Set-AzResource -ResourceId $resource.ResourceId -Tag $resourceTags -Force
}
```

---

## 7. Service-Specific Cost Optimization

### AKS Cost Optimization

**Problem**: AKS cluster costs $5,000/month, mostly idle

**Solutions**:

1. **Right-size node pools**:
```bash
# Enable cluster autoscaler
az aks nodepool update \
  --cluster-name aks-prod \
  --name nodepool1 \
  --min-count 3 \
  --max-count 10 \
  --enable-cluster-autoscaler
```

2. **Use Spot VMs for fault-tolerant workloads**:
```bash
az aks nodepool add \
  --cluster-name aks-prod \
  --name spotpool \
  --priority Spot \
  --eviction-policy Delete \
  --spot-max-price -1 \
  --node-count 3

# Savings: Up to 90% for batch jobs
```

### Cosmos DB Cost Optimization

**Problem**: Cosmos DB costs $2,000/month with 20,000 RU/s provisioned

**Solutions**:

1. **Use Autoscale instead of Manual**:
```bash
# Before: 20,000 RU/s manual = $1,920/month (always on)
# After: 2,000-20,000 RU/s autoscale = $960/month avg

az cosmosdb sql container throughput update \
  --account-name mycosmosdb \
  --database-name mydb \
  --name mycontainer \
  --max-throughput 20000  # Autoscale
```

2. **Optimize queries** (reduce RU consumption):
```sql
-- Bad: Full collection scan (1000 RUs)
SELECT * FROM c WHERE c.status = 'active'

-- Good: Use index (5 RUs)
SELECT c.id, c.name FROM c WHERE c.status = 'active'
```

### Storage Cost Optimization

**Problem**: 100 TB of blob storage costs $2,000/month in Hot tier

**Solution: Use lifecycle management**:
```json
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "name": "move-to-cool-after-30-days",
      "type": "Lifecycle",
      "definition": {
        "filters": {
          "blobTypes": ["blockBlob"]
        },
        "actions": {
          "baseBlob": {
            "tierToCool": {
              "daysAfterModificationGreaterThan": 30
            },
            "tierToArchive": {
              "daysAfterModificationGreaterThan": 90
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Savings**:
- Hot: $0.0184/GB = $1,884/month for 100 TB
- Cool: $0.01/GB = $1,024/month (46% savings)
- Archive: $0.00099/GB = $101/month (95% savings)

## 6. Interview Questions

### Beginner Level

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Q1: What is the difference between CapEx and OpEx?">
    **Answer**:
    - **CapEx (Capital Expenditure)**: Upfront cost for physical infrastructure (Servers, Datacenters). depreciated over time.
    - **OpEx (Operational Expenditure)**: Pay-as-you-go model (Cloud). Billed for what you use immediately. No upfront cost.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Q2: How can I stop a VM from billing me?">
    **Answer**:
    You must **Deallocate** the VM (Stopped/Deallocated).
    Just shutting down the OS (Stopped) still reserves the hardware and incurs compute charges.
    *Note: Storage (Disk) is still billed even when deallocated.*
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Intermediate Level

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Q3: Explain the difference between Reserved Instances and Spot VMs">
    **Answer**:
    - **Reserved Instances (RI)**: Commit to 1 or 3 years for steady workloads. ~40-70% savings. Guaranteed capacity.
    - **Spot VMs**: Bid on unused Azure capacity. ~90% savings. No guarantee (can be evicted). Good for stateless/batch jobs.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Q4: What is Azure Hybrid Benefit?">
    **Answer**:
    A licensing benefit that lets you bring your own on-premises Windows Server and SQL Server licenses (with Software Assurance) to Azure.
    It removes the cost of the OS license from the hourly VM rate, saving up to 40%.

  <Accordion title="Q5: How do you implement a chargeback model in a multi-tenant subscription?">
    **Answer**:
    1. **Tagging Policy**: Enforce a `CostCenter` tag on all resources via Azure Policy.
    2. **Cost Management**: Create cost views filtered by tag.
    3. **Exports**: Export cost data to Azure Storage/Power BI for custom reporting.
    4. **Subscription Partitioning**: For strict isolation, give each tenant their own Subscription (Management Groups for governance).
