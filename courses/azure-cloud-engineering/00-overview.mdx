# Azure Cloud Engineering Master Course

## Start Here if You're Completely New to Cloud

**What is Cloud Computing?**

Imagine you want to start a restaurant:

**Traditional Approach (Buy Everything):**
- Buy building ($500,000)
- Buy kitchen equipment ($100,000)
- Buy furniture ($50,000)
- Hire staff ($200,000/year)
- **Problem:** What if restaurant fails? You lose $650,000!

**Cloud Approach (Rent Everything):**
- Rent building ($3,000/month)
- Rent kitchen equipment ($1,000/month)
- Rent furniture ($500/month)
- Hire staff as needed
- **Benefit:** If restaurant fails, you only lose a few months of rent!

**Cloud Computing = Renting computer resources instead of buying them**

Instead of:
- **Buying** physical servers ($10,000 each)
- **Maintaining** air conditioning, security, backups
- **Upgrading** hardware every 3-5 years

You:
- **Rent** virtual servers ($50/month)
- **Microsoft** handles maintenance, security, backups
- **Scale** up or down in minutes

---

## What is Microsoft Azure?

**Azure** is Microsoft's cloud computing platform. Think of it as:

**Microsoft owns massive data centers** around the world (60+ regions)
- Buildings full of servers, storage, networking equipment
- Powered 24/7, secured, maintained by Microsoft

**You rent resources** from these data centers:
- Virtual machines (computers)
- Databases
- Storage (file storage)
- Networking
- AI services
- And 200+ other services

**Real Numbers:**
- **95% of Fortune 500** companies use Azure
- **$60+ billion** in annual revenue
- **60+ regions** worldwide
- **200+ services** available

---

## Why Should You Learn Azure?

**Career Opportunities:**
- **200,000+ job openings** for Azure skills (globally)
- **Average salary:** $120,000-$180,000 in the US
- **High demand:** More jobs than qualified candidates

**Real Example:**
- Junior Cloud Engineer: $85,000/year
- Mid-level Azure Engineer: $125,000/year
- Senior Azure Architect: $165,000/year
- Principal Cloud Architect: $220,000+/year

**Industry Growth:**
- Cloud market growing 20%+ per year
- Azure growing faster than AWS in enterprise
- Companies migrating from on-premises to cloud

---

## What Makes This Course Different?

> **Microsoft Azure** is the world's second-largest cloud platform, powering Fortune 500 companies and startups alike. This comprehensive course takes you from cloud fundamentals to designing and deploying enterprise-grade, production-ready Azure solutions.

**Most Azure courses teach you:**
- How to click buttons in the Azure Portal
- Basic tutorials without real-world context
- Theory without practical application

**This course teaches you:**
- **The "Why"**: Why Azure works the way it does (internal architecture)
- **The "How"**: How to actually build production systems
- **The "What"**: What mistakes cost companies millions
- **Real costs**: Actual dollar amounts, not vague estimates
- **Real incidents**: What went wrong and how to prevent it

**Real Example from This Course:**

Other courses:
> "Azure has load balancers. Here's how to create one in the Portal."

This course:
> "Target lost $440M on Black Friday because they chose the wrong load balancer. Here's why Azure has 4 different load balancers, when to use each one, real cost comparisons ($18/month vs $125/month), and a decision tree to prevent you from making the same mistake."

This course goes beyond basic tutorials. You'll learn Azure's internal architecture, advanced networking, security patterns, cost optimization strategies, and real-world troubleshooting—everything you need to ace Azure certifications and excel in cloud engineering roles.

## Prerequisites

### What You Need to Know Before Starting

**Don't worry if you don't have all of these!** This course is designed to teach from the ground up, but having these basics will help you learn faster.

**Essential (Highly Recommended):**

1. **Basic Computer Skills**

## Cost Considerations

### How Much Will This Course Cost You?

**The Good News:** You can complete this entire course for **$0** using Azure's free tier!

**The Reality:** Most students spend **$20-$50** total because they forget to delete resources or want to experiment beyond free tier limits.

---

### Azure Free Tier (What You Get for Free)

**Option 1: Azure Free Account**

When you sign up for Azure, you get:

1. **$200 credit** for first 30 days
   - Use for anything
   - Experiment freely
   - No credit card charges until credit runs out

2. **12 months of free services** (limited amounts)
   - 750 hours/month of B1S VM (Linux or Windows)
   - 5 GB Blob Storage
   - 250 GB SQL Database
   - 1 million Azure Functions executions
   - And 40+ other services

3. **Always-free services** (forever!)
   - 1 million Azure Functions requests/month
   - 400 RU/s Cosmos DB
   - 5 GB Azure Files
   - And 25+ other services

**Cost for this course:** $0 if you stay within limits

---

**Option 2: Azure Student Account** (If you're a student)

Best option for students:
- **$100 credit** (renews annually)
- No credit card required
- Access to student-only resources
- Verify with .edu email

**Cost for this course:** $0 (easily fits within $100/year)

---

**Option 3: Azure Pass** (From conferences, events)

Sometimes Microsoft gives away Azure Passes:
- Typically $50-$100 credit
- Valid for 30 days
- Great for this course

---

### Estimated Costs (Real Numbers)

**If you stay within free tier:**
- **Total cost:** $0 ✅

**If you exceed free tier (common mistakes):**

| Mistake | Cost | How to Avoid |
|---------|------|-------------|
| Left VM running overnight | $15/month | Stop (deallocate) VM when done |
| Created Standard Load Balancer | $18/month | Use Basic tier for learning |
| Deployed Application Gateway | $125/month | Use for specific labs only, delete after |
| Created ExpressRoute | $56-$1,627/month | NEVER create unless required! |
| Stored 100 GB in Blob Storage | $2/month | Delete old data, use free tier limits |

**Most Common Scenario:**
- Student forgets to stop VM
- Runs for 30 days
- Cost: $36 (B2s VM × 720 hours × $0.05/hour)

---

### Cost Optimization Tips (Avoid Surprise Bills)

**1. ALWAYS Stop VMs When Not In Use**

```bash
# WRONG (Still charges for compute!)
Stop-AzVM -Name "myVM" -ResourceGroupName "myRG"

# CORRECT (Stops charging)
Stop-AzVM -Name "myVM" -ResourceGroupName "myRG" -Force

# Verify it's deallocated
Get-AzVM -Name "myVM" -Status
# Should show "VM deallocated"
```

**Savings:** $36/month per VM

---

**2. Set Up Cost Alerts**

Create budget alert in Azure Portal:
```
1. Portal → Cost Management → Budgets
2. Create budget: $10/month
3. Alert at 80% ($8)
4. Email notification
```

**Benefit:** Get warned before surprise bill

---

**3. Delete Resources After Each Lab**

After each chapter, delete the entire resource group:
```bash
# Delete everything in one command
az group delete --name "chapter3-lab" --yes --no-wait
```

**Savings:** Prevents accumulation of forgotten resources

---

**4. Use B-series VMs (Burstable)**

For learning:
```
❌ Don't use: D-series (expensive, $70/month)
✅ Use: B1s ($5/month) or B2s ($36/month)
```

**B-series VMs:**
- Cheaper (60% less)
- Perfect for dev/test
- Can "burst" when needed
- Idle most of the time → Lower cost

---

**5. Use Azure Policy to Prevent Expensive Resources**

Create policy to block expensive resources:
```json
{
  "if": {
    "field": "type",
    "equals": "Microsoft.Network/expressRouteCircuits"
  },
  "then": {
    "effect": "deny"
  }
}
```

**Benefit:** Prevents accidental creation of $1,627/month ExpressRoute

---

### What If You Get a Bill?

**Surprise bill < $50:**
- Identify what caused it (Cost Analysis in Portal)
- Delete the resource
- Set up budget alert for future

**Surprise bill > $50:**
- Contact Azure Support immediately
- Explain you're a student/learning
- They often waive first-time mistakes
- Show you've deleted the resource

**Real Example:**
- Student created Application Gateway by accident
- Bill: $125 for one month
- Contacted support with explanation
- Microsoft waived the charge ✅

---

### Cost Summary for This Course

**Best case (free tier):** $0
**Typical case (minor mistakes):** $20-$50
**Worst case (left VMs running):** $100-$200
**With proper cleanup:** $0-$20

**Our Recommendation:**
1. Start with Azure Free Account ($200 credit)
2. Set budget alert at $20
3. Delete resources after each lab
4. Total course cost: **$10-$30**
