# Google Cloud Engineering Master Course

## Start Here if You're Completely New to Cloud

### 0.1 What is Cloud Computing? (From Scratch)

**What is Cloud Computing?**

Imagine you want to start a world-class restaurant chain:

**Traditional Approach (Buy Everything):**
- **Capital Expenditure (CapEx):** You buy the land ($2,000,000), construct the building ($5,000,000), buy industrial-grade ovens ($200,000), and furniture ($100,000).
- **Maintenance:** You hire a full-time team to fix the roof, service the ovens, and manage the electricity.
- **Risk:** If people don't like your food, you are stuck with a $7.3 million debt and a building you can't easily sell.
- **Scaling:** If your restaurant is a hit and you need more space, you have to buy the neighboring land and start construction again (takes 12–18 months).

**Cloud Approach (Rent Everything):**
- **Operational Expenditure (OpEx):** You rent a pre-built commercial kitchen ($10,000/month).
- **Managed Services:** The landlord handles the building maintenance, utilities, and even provides a cleaning crew.
- **Risk:** If the restaurant fails, you simply stop paying rent and walk away. Your loss is limited to a few thousand dollars.
- **Scaling:** If you suddenly have 1,000 customers waiting, the landlord opens up the dining room next door immediately. You pay a bit more rent, but you never lose a customer due to lack of space.

**Cloud Computing = Renting Google's Planet-Scale Infrastructure**

Instead of:
- **Buying** physical servers (the "hardware")
- **Managing** massive air conditioning units, diesel generators, and physical security guards
- **Waiting** 3 months for a new server to be delivered and racked

You:
- **Rent** virtual resources via an API or Web Console
- **Google** handles the "boring" stuff (power, cooling, hardware failure)
- **Scale** from 1 server to 10,000 servers in under 5 minutes

### 0.2 Key Cloud Characteristics

Before we dive into GCP, it helps to know the standard NIST cloud characteristics:

- **On‑demand self‑service** – Developer can provision resources without human approval.
- **Broad network access** – Access over the network (browser, CLI, APIs) from many device types.
- **Resource pooling** – Physical resources are shared across many customers (multi‑tenancy).
- **Rapid elasticity** – Scale out/in quickly; appears unlimited from user perspective.
- **Measured service** – You pay for what you use (per second/minute/GB), with detailed metering.

We will see these show up repeatedly when we talk about autoscaling, managed databases, serverless, and cost management.

## What is Google Cloud Platform (GCP)?

GCP is a suite of cloud computing services that runs on the **same infrastructure** that Google uses internally for its end-user products, such as Google Search, YouTube, Gmail, and Google Drive.

### 1.1 The Google Edge

- **Global Network:** Google owns one of the largest private networks in the world. Thousands of miles of undersea fiber optic cables connect their data centers.
- **Planet-Scale Databases:** Services like Cloud Spanner offer "TrueTime"—a global clock synchronized by atomic clocks and GPS satellites.
- **Innovation:** Google invented many of the technologies the world uses today, including Kubernetes (Borg), MapReduce, and TensorFlow.

### 1.2 By the Numbers

- **35+ Regions** (Geographical locations)
- **100+ Zones** (Isolated data centers within regions)
- **187+ Network Edge Locations** (Points of Presence)
- **0% Net Carbon Emissions** (Google matches 100% of its electricity consumption with renewable energy)

### 1.3 Shared Responsibility Model (High Level)

Even with managed infrastructure, there are **clear lines** between what Google secures and what **you** must configure:

- Google: physical security, hardware, hypervisor, some managed service internals.  
- You: IAM, network access, application code, data classification, backups (for some services).

We will revisit this in the Security chapters, but keep it in mind from the start: **cloud does not remove responsibility, it changes it.**

## Why Should You Learn GCP?

**The Market Reality:**
While AWS has the largest market share, GCP is the **fastest-growing** major cloud provider. Enterprises are moving to GCP for three main reasons:
1. **AI and Machine Learning:** Google is the undisputed leader in AI.
2. **Data Analytics:** BigQuery is widely considered the best cloud data warehouse.
3. **Open Source DNA:** GCP is built on open standards like Kubernetes and Istio, reducing vendor lock-in.

**Career & Salary (US Data):**
- **Associate Cloud Engineer:** $110,000 - $145,000
- **Professional Cloud Architect:** $164,000 - $210,000 (Highest paying certification in IT for 3 consecutive years)
- **Cloud Security Engineer:** $170,000 - $230,000
- **Machine Learning Engineer:** $180,000 - $250,000+

## What Makes This Course Different?

> "Most GCP courses teach you how to click buttons in the Console. This course teaches you how to think like a Google Site Reliability Engineer (SRE)."

### 2.1 Philosophy of the Course

**We don't just show you how to create a VM. We explain:**
- How the **Andromeda** software-defined network routes your traffic.
- Why **Colossus** (Google's file system) is the secret behind Cloud Storage's durability.
- How to design for **99.999% availability** using Multi-Regional architectures.
- The **FinOps** strategies used to save millions on egress costs.

### 2.2 Real-World Example

*Scenario:* A major social media platform experienced a 4-hour outage because they misconfigured their Global Load Balancer.

*In this course:* We break down that specific incident, show you the configuration that caused it, and teach you how to use **Cloud Armor** and **Health Checks** to ensure it never happens to your systems.

Throughout the course we will map every concept to:
- **Real Google services** (e.g., GFE, Andromeda, Colossus).  
- **Real operational practices** (SRE, observability, incident response).  
- **Real cost trade‑offs** (performance vs spend).

## The SRE Foundation: Learning the "Google Way"

Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) is what happens when you ask a software engineer to design an operations team. This course is heavily inspired by the three definitive texts published by Google:

1.  **The SRE Book:** How Google runs production systems.
2.  **The SRE Workbook:** Practical ways to implement SRE.
3.  **Building Secure & Reliable Systems:** The intersection of security and reliability.

Throughout this course, we refer to these as the "Google Triad." You will learn to apply concepts like **Error Budgets**, **Toil Reduction**, and **Post-Mortem culture** directly to your GCP resources. We don't just want you to build systems that work; we want you to build systems that are *maintainable at scale*.

## Prerequisites: "Test Yourself"

You don't need to be an expert, but you should check these basics. If you fail a "Test Yourself," we recommend a quick 30-minute refresher on that topic.

### 4.1 Networking Fundamentals

- **Concept:** Do you know the difference between a Private IP and a Public IP?
- **Test Yourself:** Can you explain what a Subnet Mask (e.g., /24) does?
- **Refresher:** Look up "CIDR Notation" and "OSI Model Layer 3 vs 4."

### 4.2 Linux Command Line

- **Concept:** Are you comfortable moving through a file system without a mouse?
- **Test Yourself:** Can you write a command to find all files ending in `.log` and delete them?
- **Refresher:** Practice `cd`, `ls`, `grep`, `find`, and `chmod`.

### 4.3 Basic Programming (Optional but Recommended)

- **Concept:** Understanding logic (If/Else, Loops).
- **Test Yourself:** Can you read a basic Python script and tell what it does?
- **Note:** We use Python and Node.js for some serverless examples.

For each prerequisite, we will link to short refresher resources in the **Essentials** section of the docs so you can quickly fill gaps before diving into the main modules.

## Cost Management: The $300 "Safe Zone"

Google provides a **$300 Free Credit** for 90 days. We have designed this course to be completed entirely within that credit.

### 5.1 The "SRE" Way to Save Money

1. **Budgets and Alerts:**  
   We will set a $10 budget alert early in the course so you see how budget alerts work.

2. **Auto-Delete Scripts:**  
   We provide scripts and guidance to safely **delete lab resources** by project or label in one shot.

3. **Spot VMs:**  
   We will use Spot (Preemptible) instances for expensive labs to save up to ~90% compared to on‑demand.

4. **Scale to Zero:**  
   We prioritize services like Cloud Run and Firestore which cost $0 when not in use.

You will learn to treat **cost** like **latency** or **error rate**: measured, monitored, and actively optimized.

## Interview Preparation

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Q1: Why would a company choose GCP over AWS or Azure? What are GCP's unique technical strengths?">
    **Answer:** GCP's differentiation is built on Google's internal technology heritage:
    
    1.  **Networking:** Google's private B4 backbone provides consistently lower latency (25-35% improvement over public internet) and Andromeda SDN eliminates the "noisy neighbor" problem found in virtualized network appliances.
    2.  **Data Platform:** BigQuery is the industry-leading serverless data warehouse. It's built on Dremel (the same engine Google uses internally) and offers true separation of compute and storage with Jupiter network speeds (1.3 Pbps).
    3.  **Kubernetes Origins:** GKE is the most mature managed Kubernetes offering because Google invented Kubernetes (from Project Borg). Autopilot mode is years ahead of competitors in terms of hands-off operation.
    4.  **AI/ML Leadership:** Google's Vertex AI is built on the same infrastructure as Google Search and Gmail. TensorFlow and JAX are Google products, giving GCP first-class support.
    5.  **Open Standards:** GCP embraces open standards (Kubernetes, Istio, Envoy) reducing vendor lock-in compared to proprietary services in other clouds.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Q2: Explain the GCP Resource Hierarchy and why it matters for security and governance.">
    **Answer:** The hierarchy is: **Organization → Folders → Projects → Resources**. 
    
    **Why it matters:**
    
    *   **IAM Inheritance:** Permissions flow downward. If you grant "Viewer" at the Organization level, that permission applies to every project and resource underneath. This is both powerful (centralized control) and dangerous (overprivileged access).
    *   **Organization Policies:** Enforceable constraints (like "disable external IPs") applied at the Org or Folder level cannot be overridden by lower levels. This prevents shadow IT from creating insecure resources.
    *   **Billing Aggregation:** Folders allow you to group projects by department or environment, enabling cost allocation and budget alerts at the appropriate level.
    *   **Blast Radius:** Projects are trust boundaries. By default, resources in Project A cannot communicate with Project B unless explicitly configured (VPC Peering, Shared VPC). This limits the damage from a compromised workload.
    
    **Interview Deep Dive:** An ideal enterprise setup separates Prod and Non-Prod into distinct folders, uses a Shared VPC for network centralization, and aggregates audit logs into a separate "Security" folder project to prevent tampering by application teams.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Q3: What are the key differences between the Professional Cloud Architect and Professional Cloud Engineer certifications?">
    **Answer:** 
    
    **Professional Cloud Architect (PCA):**
    
    *   **Focus:** Design and architecture. Scenario-based questions testing system design, capacity planning, and trade-offs.
    *   **Skills:** Designing for scalability, reliability, security, and compliance. Understanding business requirements and translating them into GCP solutions.
    *   **Exam:** Case studies where you analyze a company's requirements and recommend architectures.
    
    **Professional Cloud Engineer (PCE):**
    
    *   **Focus:** Implementation and operation. Hands-on deployment, troubleshooting, and managing GCP resources.
    *   **Skills:** Terraform, gcloud CLI, GKE operations, and observability tooling.
    *   **Exam:** Task-based questions like "How would you debug a failing health check?" or "What gcloud command deploys this configuration?"
    
    **Career Path:** Many engineers earn PCA first (it's considered harder and more prestigious), then follow up with PCE to demonstrate hands-on skills. Both are valuable, but PCA often commands a higher salary ($164k-210k vs. $110k-145k).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Q4: How does Google's Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) model influence GCP's service design?">
    **Answer:** Google invented SRE. The core SRE principles are embedded into GCP services:
    
    1.  **Error Budgets:** Instead of aiming for 100% uptime (impossible and wasteful), Google defines Service Level Objectives (SLOs) like 99.95%. The remaining 0.05% is an "error budget." If the budget isn't exhausted, teams can deploy faster. If it's exhausted, they must stop features and focus on reliability.
    2.  **Toil Automation:** SREs measure "toil"—manual, repetitive work. GCP services like GKE Autopilot, Cloud Run autoscaling, and Cloud SQL automated backups are all designed to eliminate toil for customers.
    3.  **Observability by Default:** Every GCP service integrates with Cloud Monitoring, Logging, and Trace out of the box. This reflects Google's belief that "you can't manage what you can't measure."
    4.  **Blameless Post-Mortems:** When a GCP service fails, Google publishes detailed incident reports explaining root cause and prevention measures. This culture encourages transparency and continuous learning.
    
    **Interview Insight:** Mentioning SRE principles in answers demonstrates that you understand not just *what* GCP offers, but *why* it's designed that way—showing strategic thinking beyond tool usage.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Q5: What is the most common mistake beginners make when using GCP, and how do you avoid it?">
    **Answer:** **Overprivileged Service Accounts**. 
    
    **The Mistake:** Many beginners use the "Default Compute Engine Service Account" or grant the "Editor" role at the project level. This violates the Principle of Least Privilege. If a VM is compromised, the attacker inherits those broad permissions, allowing them to read secrets, delete databases, or exfiltrate data.
    
    **The Fix:**
    
    1.  **Custom Service Accounts:** Always create a dedicated SA for each workload.
    2.  **Predefined Roles:** Use the most granular predefined role (e.g., `roles/storage.objectViewer` instead of `roles/editor`).
    3.  **Workload Identity (for GKE):** Never use JSON keys. Bind Kubernetes Service Accounts to Google Service Accounts using Workload Identity, eliminating the risk of key leakage.
    4.  **IAM Recommender:** Google's ML-powered tool analyzes 90 days of API usage and recommends removing unused permissions. Check it weekly.
    
    **Interview Depth:** Mention that you would also use **VPC Service Controls** for critical workloads to create a secondary defense layer, ensuring that even a compromised SA cannot exfiltrate data outside the defined perimeter.
