## 9.1 The Complete Picture of IP Addresses

### What is an IP Address Really?

An IP address is a **logical address** assigned to a device on a network. Unlike MAC addresses (which are burned into hardware), IP addresses are:

- **Configurable**: Can be changed
- **Hierarchical**: Contain network and host portions
- **Routable**: Used to find paths across networks

### IPv4 Address Structure

A 32-bit number, typically shown in **dotted-decimal notation**:

```
192.168.1.100

Binary: 11000000.10101000.00000001.01100100
        └──────┘ └──────┘ └──────┘ └──────┘
          192      168       1       100
```

Each **octet** (8 bits) can range from 0 to 255.

---

## 9.2 Network ID vs Host ID

Every IP address has two parts:

| Part | Purpose | Analogy |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Network ID** | Identifies the network | Street name |
| **Host ID** | Identifies the specific device | House number |

The **subnet mask** determines where the split occurs.

### Example

```
IP Address:    192.168.1.100
Subnet Mask:   255.255.255.0

Network ID:    192.168.1.0    (First 24 bits)
Host ID:       0.0.0.100      (Last 8 bits)
```

<Note>
**Mental Model**: Think of the Network ID as your ZIP code (gets you to the right neighborhood) and Host ID as your street address (finds the exact house).
</Note>

---

## 9.3 CIDR Notation Explained

**CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing)** replaced the old class-based system. It uses a **prefix length** to indicate how many bits belong to the network portion.

### The Notation

```
192.168.1.0/24
            └── 24 bits for network, 8 bits for hosts
```

### Common CIDR Blocks

| CIDR | Subnet Mask | # of Hosts | Use Case |
|------|-------------|------------|----------|
| /32 | 255.255.255.255 | 1 | Single host |
| /31 | 255.255.255.254 | 2 | Point-to-point links |
| /30 | 255.255.255.252 | 2 | Point-to-point (with network/broadcast) |
| /29 | 255.255.255.248 | 6 | Tiny subnet |
| /28 | 255.255.255.240 | 14 | Small subnet |
| /27 | 255.255.255.224 | 30 | Small office |
| /26 | 255.255.255.192 | 62 | Medium subnet |
| /25 | 255.255.255.128 | 126 | Large subnet |
| /24 | 255.255.255.0 | 254 | Standard LAN |
| /16 | 255.255.0.0 | 65,534 | Large organization |
| /8 | 255.0.0.0 | 16,777,214 | Massive network |

### Calculating Hosts

```
Number of usable hosts = 2^(32 - prefix) - 2

Example: /24 network
= 2^(32-24) - 2
= 2^8 - 2
= 256 - 2
= 254 usable hosts
```

<Warning>
**Why -2?** The first address is the **Network Address** (all host bits = 0) and the last is the **Broadcast Address** (all host bits = 1). Neither can be assigned to a host.
</Warning>

## 9.4 Subnetting Step-by-Step

### Problem: Divide 192.168.1.0/24 into 4 equal subnets

**Step 1: Determine bits needed**
```
4 subnets = 2^n where n = 2
Need to borrow 2 bits from host portion
```

**Step 2: Calculate new prefix**
```
Original: /24
Borrowed: 2 bits
New prefix: /26
```

**Step 3: Calculate subnet size**
```
Hosts per subnet = 2^(32-26) - 2 = 62 hosts
Block size = 64 (2^6)
```

**Step 4: List the subnets**

| Subnet | Network Address | First Host | Last Host | Broadcast |
|--------|-----------------|------------|-----------|-----------|
| 1 | 192.168.1.0/26 | 192.168.1.1 | 192.168.1.62 | 192.168.1.63 |
| 2 | 192.168.1.64/26 | 192.168.1.65 | 192.168.1.126 | 192.168.1.127 |
| 3 | 192.168.1.128/26 | 192.168.1.129 | 192.168.1.190 | 192.168.1.191 |
| 4 | 192.168.1.192/26 | 192.168.1.193 | 192.168.1.254 | 192.168.1.255 |

### Quick Subnet Cheat Sheet

For /24 networks being subnetted:

| New Prefix | Subnets | Hosts/Subnet | Block Size |
|------------|---------|--------------|------------|
| /25 | 2 | 126 | 128 |
| /26 | 4 | 62 | 64 |
| /27 | 8 | 30 | 32 |
| /28 | 16 | 14 | 16 |
| /29 | 32 | 6 | 8 |
| /30 | 64 | 2 | 4 |

## 9.5 Private vs Public IP Addresses

### The Problem

There are only ~4.3 billion IPv4 addresses (2^32), but billions of devices need to connect.

### The Solution: Private IP Ranges

**RFC 1918** reserved three blocks for private use:

| Range | CIDR | # of Addresses | Typical Use |
|-------|------|----------------|-------------|
| 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 | 10.0.0.0/8 | 16,777,216 | Large enterprises, Cloud VPCs |
| 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 | 172.16.0.0/12 | 1,048,576 | Medium organizations |
| 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 | 192.168.0.0/16 | 65,536 | Home/Small office |

### Key Rules

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Private IPs" icon="house">
    - **Not routable** on the public internet
    - Can be **reused** by any organization
    - Need **NAT** to reach the internet
    - Free to use, no registration needed
  </Card>
  <Card title="Public IPs" icon="globe">
    - **Globally unique** and routable
    - Assigned by **IANA → RIRs → ISPs**
    - Must be **purchased/leased**
    - Required for internet-facing services
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Can Multiple Organizations Use the Same Private IP?

**Yes!** This is exactly the point. Consider:

```
Company A Office:          Company B Office:
┌─────────────────┐        ┌─────────────────┐
│ 192.168.1.0/24  │        │ 192.168.1.0/24  │
│                 │        │                 │
│ PC: 192.168.1.5 │        │ PC: 192.168.1.5 │
│ PC: 192.168.1.6 │        │ PC: 192.168.1.6 │
└────────┬────────┘        └────────┬────────┘
         │                          │
    NAT Gateway               NAT Gateway
    Public: 203.0.113.10      Public: 198.51.100.20
         │                          │
         └──────────┬───────────────┘
                    │
              ┌─────┴─────┐
              │  Internet │
              └───────────┘
```

Both companies use `192.168.1.5` internally, but that's fine because:
1. Private IPs never leave their local network
2. NAT translates them to unique public IPs before packets hit the internet
3. The internet only sees the public IPs

---

## 9.6 Special IP Addresses

| Address/Range | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|
| 0.0.0.0 | "This network" / Default route |
| 127.0.0.0/8 | Loopback (localhost) |
| 169.254.0.0/16 | Link-local (APIPA) - when DHCP fails |
| 224.0.0.0/4 | Multicast |
| 255.255.255.255 | Broadcast |

---

## 9.7 IPv6 Addressing

### Why IPv6?

IPv4 has ~4.3 billion addresses. IPv6 has:
```
2^128 = 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 addresses
```

That's 340 undecillion addresses - enough to assign trillions of addresses to every grain of sand on Earth.

### IPv6 Format

```
2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334

8 groups of 4 hexadecimal digits (16 bits each)
Total: 128 bits
```

### Simplification Rules

1. **Leading zeros can be omitted**:
   ```
   2001:0db8 → 2001:db8
   ```

2. **Consecutive zero groups can be replaced with `::`** (once per address):
   ```
   2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001
   → 2001:db8::1
   ```

### IPv6 Address Types

| Type | Prefix | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Global Unicast | 2000::/3 | Public, routable (like IPv4 public) |
| Link-Local | fe80::/10 | Auto-configured, not routable |
| Unique Local | fc00::/7 | Private (like RFC 1918) |
| Loopback | ::1 | Localhost |

## 9.8 Practice Problems

<Accordion title="Problem 1: Given 10.0.0.0/8, how many /24 networks can you create?">
**Solution:**

```
/8 has 24 bits for hosts (32 - 8 = 24)
/24 has 8 bits for hosts (32 - 24 = 8)

Bits to borrow: 24 - 8 = 16 bits
Number of /24 networks: 2^16 = 65,536

Answer: You can create 65,536 /24 networks from a /8
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Problem 2: What subnet does 172.16.45.130/26 belong to?">
**Solution:**

```
/26 means 26 network bits, 6 host bits
Block size = 2^6 = 64

172.16.45.130 ÷ 64 = 2.03... → Subnet starts at 2 × 64 = 128

Network: 172.16.45.128/26
Range: 172.16.45.128 - 172.16.45.191
Broadcast: 172.16.45.191
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Problem 3: Design subnets for an office with 3 departments">
**Requirements:**
- Engineering: 50 hosts
- Sales: 20 hosts  
- HR: 10 hosts
- Starting block: 192.168.10.0/24

**Solution:**

| Dept | Hosts Needed | Subnet Size | CIDR | Range |
|------|--------------|-------------|------|-------|
| Engineering | 50 | /26 (62 hosts) | 192.168.10.0/26 | .1 - .62 |
| Sales | 20 | /27 (30 hosts) | 192.168.10.64/27 | .65 - .94 |
| HR | 10 | /28 (14 hosts) | 192.168.10.96/28 | .97 - .110 |

Remaining: 192.168.10.112 - 192.168.10.255 (for future use)
