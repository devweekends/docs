## 1.1 What is a Computer Network?

A computer network is a set of computers sharing resources located on or provided by network nodes. The computers use common communication protocols over digital interconnections to communicate with each other.

### Key Components
- **Nodes**: Devices like computers, servers, phones.
- **Links**: Physical or wireless connections (cables, fiber, Wi-Fi).
- **Protocols**: Rules governing data exchange (TCP/IP, HTTP).

## 1.2 Types of Networks

- **LAN (Local Area Network)**: Connects devices within a limited area (home, office).
- **WAN (Wide Area Network)**: Covers a broad area (e.g., the Internet).
- **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)**: Connects users in a city.
- **PAN (Personal Area Network)**: Individual workspace (Bluetooth).

## 1.3 The Internet

The Internet is a global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide.

### How it works (High Level)
1.  **Client** sends a request.
2.  **Router** directs the traffic.
3.  **ISP** connects to the backbone.
4.  **Server** processes the request and sends a response.
