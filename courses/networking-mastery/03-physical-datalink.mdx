# Module 3: Physical & Data Link Layers

These layers are responsible for moving bits across the wire (or air) and organizing them into frames for local delivery.

---

## 3.1 Layer 1: Physical Layer

The Physical Layer defines the hardware elements involved in transmitting data.

### Key Concepts
- **Media**: Copper cables (Cat5e, Cat6), Fiber Optic, Wireless (Radio waves).
- **Signals**: Digital (bits) vs Analog (waves).
- **Topologies**: Bus, Star, Ring, Mesh.

## 3.2 Layer 2: Data Link Layer

The Data Link Layer ensures error-free transmission between two directly connected nodes.

### MAC Addresses
- **Media Access Control (MAC)** address is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC).
- Format: `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E` (48-bit hex).

### Ethernet Frames
Data is packaged into **frames**.
- **Preamble**: Synchronization.
- **Destination MAC**: Where it's going.
- **Source MAC**: Where it came from.
- **Type**: Protocol (e.g., IPv4).
- **Payload**: The actual data (IP Packet).
- **FCS**: Frame Check Sequence (Error detection).

## 3.3 Switching

A **Switch** operates at Layer 2. It uses MAC addresses to forward frames to the correct port.

1.  **Learning**: Switch learns MAC addresses by inspecting Source MAC of incoming frames.
2.  **Forwarding**: Switch looks up Destination MAC in its MAC Table and forwards to the specific port.
3.  **Flooding**: If Destination MAC is unknown (or Broadcast), switch sends to all ports (except ingress).
