# Module 8: Advanced Networking

As networks scale, new paradigms emerge.

---

## 8.1 SDN (Software-Defined Networking)

SDN separates the **Control Plane** (decision making) from the **Data Plane** (forwarding).
-   **Centralized Controller**: Manages the network programmatically.
-   **OpenFlow**: Protocol for communication between controller and switches.

---

## 8.2 Cloud Networking (AWS VPC)

In the cloud, networking is virtualized.
-   **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)**: Isolated network environment.
-   **Subnets**: Public (Internet Gateway) vs Private (NAT Gateway).
-   **Security Groups**: Virtual firewalls for instances.

---

## 8.3 IPv6

IPv4 ran out of addresses. IPv6 solves this.
-   **128-bit addresses**: Hexadecimal (e.g., `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`).
-   **No NAT**: Every device can have a public IP.
-   **Simplified Header**: Better processing efficiency.
