# Module 4: Network Layer

The Network Layer (Layer 3) is responsible for routing packets across different networks. The primary protocol is **Internet Protocol (IP)**.

## 4.1 IP Addressing (IPv4)

An IPv4 address is a 32-bit number, typically written in dotted-decimal notation (e.g., `192.168.1.1`).

### Classes (Legacy)
- **Class A**: 0.0.0.0 - 127.255.255.255 (Large networks)
- **Class B**: 128.0.0.0 - 191.255.255.255 (Medium networks)
- **Class C**: 192.0.0.0 - 223.255.255.255 (Small networks)

### Private IP Addresses (RFC 1918)
- `10.0.0.0/8`
- `172.16.0.0/12`
- `192.168.0.0/16`

## 4.2 Subnetting

Subnetting divides a network into smaller, manageable sub-networks.
- **Subnet Mask**: Determines which part of the IP is the Network ID and which is the Host ID.
- Example: `255.255.255.0` (/24) means first 24 bits are Network ID.

## 4.3 Routing

**Routers** operate at Layer 3. They connect different networks and decide the best path for packets.

### Routing Protocols
- **IGP (Interior Gateway Protocol)**: Used within an autonomous system (e.g., OSPF, RIP).
- **EGP (Exterior Gateway Protocol)**: Used between autonomous systems (e.g., BGP).
