# Module 7: Network Security

Security is paramount in modern networking.

---

## 7.1 Firewalls

A **Firewall** monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.
-   **Packet Filtering**: Inspects headers (IP, Port).
-   **Stateful Inspection**: Tracks connection state.
-   **Application Layer (WAF)**: Inspects payload (HTTP).

---

## 7.2 VPN (Virtual Private Network)

A VPN extends a private network across a public network.
-   **Tunneling**: Encapsulates packets inside another protocol.
-   **Encryption**: Protects data from eavesdropping.

---

## 7.3 TLS / SSL

**Transport Layer Security (TLS)** encrypts communication over a computer network.
-   **Handshake**: Negotiates cipher suite and exchanges keys.
-   **Certificates**: Verifies identity using PKI (Public Key Infrastructure).

---

## 7.4 Common Attacks

-   **DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service)**: Overwhelming a target with traffic.
-   **MITM (Man-in-the-Middle)**: Intercepting communication.
-   **Phishing**: Deceptive emails to steal credentials.
