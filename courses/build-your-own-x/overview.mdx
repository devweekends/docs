# Build Your Own X

The **ultimate resume differentiator**. While others list "Used Redis" or "Worked with Docker", you'll confidently say **"I built my own"**. This course guides you through building three production-grade systems from scratch, each targeting a different experience level.

<Info>
**Languages**: Java, Go, JavaScript  
**Target Outcome**: Deep systems understanding + impressive portfolio projects  
**Philosophy**: Learn by building, understand by implementing  
**Why 3 Languages?**: Each language has strengths for specific domains

## Project Overview

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="🎓 Build Your Own Git (Students/Juniors)" icon="code-branch">
    **Why Git?**
    - Every developer uses Git daily, but few understand its elegant internals
    - Teaches fundamental CS concepts: SHA-1 hashing, tree structures, content-addressable storage
    - Perfect complexity level for beginners — challenging but achievable
    
    **What You'll Build:**
    - `init`, `add`, `commit`, `log`, `status`, `diff`, `branch`, `checkout`
    - Object store (blobs, trees, commits)
    - Index/staging area
    - Branch management
    
    **Resume Impact:** "Built a working Git implementation with commit history, branching, and diff functionality"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="🔧 Build Your Own Redis (Mid-Level)" icon="database">
    **Why Redis?**
    - Most popular in-memory data store — used everywhere
    - Teaches networking, protocol design, data structures at scale
    - Perfect for demonstrating systems programming skills
    
    **What You'll Build:**
    - RESP protocol parser
    - Core commands: GET, SET, DEL, EXPIRE, KEYS, PING
    - Data structures: Strings, Lists, Sets, Hashes, Sorted Sets
    - Persistence: RDB snapshots, AOF logging
    - Pub/Sub messaging
    
    **Resume Impact:** "Implemented Redis clone supporting RESP protocol, multiple data structures, and persistence"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="🚀 Build Your Own Docker (Senior)" icon="docker">
    **Why Docker?**
    - Containers are the foundation of modern infrastructure
    - Demonstrates deep Linux internals knowledge
    - The "wow factor" project that separates seniors from staff engineers
    
    **What You'll Build:**
    - Linux namespaces (PID, NET, MNT, UTS, USER)
    - Cgroups for resource limits (CPU, Memory)
    - Overlay filesystem (UnionFS concepts)
    - Container networking (bridge, veth pairs)
    - Image format and layers
    - Basic container runtime
    
    **Resume Impact:** "Built container runtime using Linux namespaces, cgroups, and overlay filesystems"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Why These Languages?

| Project | Language | Reasoning |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Git** | JavaScript | Accessible, great for learning fundamentals, Buffer API for binary data |
| **Redis** | Go | Built for networking, goroutines for concurrency, perfect for systems software |
| **Docker** | Java | Enterprise-grade, demonstrates that containers aren't "just Go", JNI for syscalls |

<Note>
Each project includes implementations in **all three languages** so you can compare approaches and pick what resonates with your career goals.
