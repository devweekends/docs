# Introduction to Go

Go (often referred to as Golang) is an open-source programming language supported by Google. It is statically typed, compiled, and designed for simplicity, concurrency, and performance.

## History and Philosophy

Go was designed at Google in 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. It was announced in 2009 and reached version 1.0 in 2012.

The language was born out of frustration with existing languages (C++, Java, Python) used for large-scale systems. The designers wanted a language that combined:
- **Efficiency** of C++ (static typing, compiled)
- **Readability** and **Usability** of Python/JavaScript
- **High-performance networking** and **multiprocessing**

### Key Characteristics
- **Simplicity**: The specification is small enough to hold in your head.
- **Fast Compilation**: Designed to compile large projects in seconds.
- **Garbage Collection**: Automatic memory management.
- **Built-in Concurrency**: Goroutines and channels are core primitives.
- **Static Typing**: Type safety without the verbosity (type inference).
- **No Inheritance**: Composition over inheritance (structs and interfaces).

## Installation

To get started with Go, download and install the latest version from the official website.

1.  Visit [go.dev/dl](https://go.dev/dl/).
2.  Download the installer for your OS (Windows, macOS, Linux).
3.  Run the installer and follow the prompts.

### Verify Installation

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
go version
```

You should see output similar to `go version go1.21.0 windows/amd64`.

## Your First Go Program

Let's write the classic "Hello, World!" program.

1.  Create a file named `main.go`.
2.  Add the following code:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```

### Running the Program

You can run it directly using the `go run` command:

```bash
go run main.go
# Output: Hello, World!
```

Or compile it into a binary:

```bash
go build main.go
./main      # On macOS/Linux
main.exe    # On Windows
```

### Code Breakdown

-   `package main`: Defines the package name. The `main` package is special; it tells the Go compiler that this should compile as an executable program rather than a shared library.
-   `import "fmt"`: Imports the `fmt` (format) package, which contains functions for formatting text, including printing to the console.
-   `func main() { ... }`: The entry point of the program. When you run the executable, this function executes first.

---

## Go Toolchain

The `go` command is a powerful tool that manages source code, dependencies, and builds.

-   `go run`: Compiles and runs the Go program.
-   `go build`: Compiles the program into an executable binary.
-   `go fmt`: Automatically formats your code (standard style is enforced).
-   `go test`: Runs tests.
-   `go mod`: Manages modules and dependencies.
-   `go get`: Downloads and installs packages.

<Tip>
**Pro Tip**: Always run `go fmt` before committing your code. The Go community has a strict standard for code formatting, and `go fmt` ensures your code complies.
