# Java Crash Course

> **Java** is the workhorse of the software industry. From massive enterprise backends and Android apps to big data processing and high-frequency trading, Java runs the world.

This crash course is designed to take you from "Hello World" to understanding the JVM, concurrency, and modern Java (17/21) features.

## Why Java?

Java has consistently been one of the top languages for 25+ years.

  <Card title="Write Once, Run Anywhere" icon="globe">
    The JVM (Java Virtual Machine) allows your code to run on any device, from servers to toasters.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Enterprise Grade" icon="building">
    Strict type safety, massive ecosystem, and backward compatibility make it the #1 choice for large systems.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Multithreading" icon="bolt">
    Built-in support for concurrency makes building scalable, high-performance applications easier.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Modern Evolution" icon="rocket">
    With a 6-month release cycle, Java is evolving fast: Records, Pattern Matching, Virtual Threads, and more.

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming knowledge.
- JDK 17 or higher installed (`java -version`).
- An IDE (IntelliJ IDEA is highly recommended, VS Code is also good).

## The Java Philosophy

> "Java is C++ without the guns, knives, and clubs." — James Gosling

Java manages memory for you (Garbage Collection), prevents buffer overflows (Array Bounds Checking), and enforces type safety. It trades some raw control for **safety** and **productivity**.
