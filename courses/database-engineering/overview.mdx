## How to Use This Course

Treat this as a **12–16 week roadmap** rather than a reference you skim once.

- **Step 1 – Foundations first**: Complete SQL Foundations → Database Design → Transactions & Concurrency before touching performance or internals.
- **Step 2 – Parallel practice**: For each concept, run the commands yourself on a local PostgreSQL instance (Docker is fine) and tweak examples until you can predict the outcome.
- **Step 3 – Performance & internals**: Once you’re comfortable writing queries, move into Indexing, Query Optimization, Performance Tuning, and the Internals track.
- **Step 4 – Production systems**: Finish with Replication, Scaling, Operational Excellence, and Case Studies; apply them to a project at work or a personal side project.
- **Step 5 – Interview & OSS**: Use the Interview Prep, Source Code, and Contributing modules in the last 2–3 weeks to polish your narrative and ship at least one small contribution (docs patch, bug report, or extension experiment).

Come back to specific modules (e.g., indexing, query plans, vacuum) whenever you hit related issues in real systems — this course is meant to be a **long-term reference** as well as a linear curriculum.
