## 14.3 Finding Your First Contribution

### Documentation Fixes

```bash
# Clone documentation
git clone https://git.postgresql.org/git/postgresql.git
cd postgresql/doc

# Find documentation issues
grep -r "TODO" src/sgml/
grep -r "FIXME" src/sgml/

# Check for unclear function docs

## 14.4 Development Workflow

### Step 1: Set Up Mailing List

```
1. Go to https://lists.postgresql.org/
2. Subscribe to pgsql-hackers (for patches)
3. Subscribe to pgsql-general (for context)
4. Read archives to understand culture and expectations
5. Lurk for a few weeks before posting
```

### Step 2: Create Your Patch

```bash
# Start from latest master
git checkout master
git pull origin master

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b my-feature

# Make your changes
vim src/backend/commands/myfile.c

# Commit with good message
git commit -m "Add feature X to command Y

This patch adds support for X when using command Y.
Previously, users had to manually do Z, which was error-prone.

Discussion: https://postgr.es/m/MESSAGE-ID"

# Generate patch
git format-patch master --stdout > my-feature.patch
```

### Step 3: Test Thoroughly

```bash
# Full regression test
make check

# Specific tests
make check TESTS="select insert update"

# Isolation tests (for concurrency)
make check -C src/test/isolation

# Your new tests
make check TESTS="my-new-test"

# Different configurations
./configure --enable-cassert
make check

# Different platforms (if possible)
# Test on Linux, macOS, Windows
```

### Email Format

```
To: pgsql-hackers@lists.postgresql.org
Subject: [PATCH] Add feature X to command Y

Hi hackers,

Attached is a patch that adds support for X when using command Y.

== Background ==

Currently, when users want to do Z, they need to manually perform 
steps A, B, and C. This is error-prone because [reasons].

== Solution ==

This patch adds a new option '--foo' to the Y command that 
automatically handles Z.

== Usage Example ==

  $ pg_dump --foo mydb > backup.sql

== Compatibility ==

This patch is backward compatible. Existing scripts continue to work.

== Testing ==

- Added regression tests in src/test/regress/sql/pg_dump.sql
- Tested on Linux x86_64 with PostgreSQL master
- make check passes

== Open Questions ==

1. Should --foo be the default in v18?
2. Is the error message clear enough?

Please review!

    I did consider B, but chose A because:
    1. [Technical reason]
    2. [Performance reason]
    3. [Compatibility reason]
    
    That said, I'm open to changing if the consensus prefers B.
    What do others think?

## 14.8 Community Etiquette

### Do's ✅

- **Be patient**: Reviews take time; contributors are volunteers
- **Be grateful**: Thank reviewers, even for criticism
- **Be thorough**: Complete patches save everyone time
- **Be responsive**: Reply within a few days
- **Be humble**: Even experts learn from review
- **Research first**: Check archives before asking

### Don'ts ❌

- **Don't ping repeatedly**: One follow-up after 2 weeks is fine
- **Don't argue endlessly**: Accept consensus gracefully
- **Don't take criticism personally**: Focus on the code
- **Don't abandon patches**: Update or withdraw properly
- **Don't submit massive patches**: Break into smaller pieces
- **Don't ignore feedback**: Address all comments

### Sample Interactions

<Accordion title="Good Response Example">
```
> I don't think we need this feature. Users can already do X.

Thanks for the feedback. I see your point about X.

However, I think this is still valuable because:
1. The current workaround requires 3 steps
2. It's error-prone (see bug #1234)
3. Other databases have this built-in

Would it help if I showed some user requests from the mailing list?

If the consensus is against, I'm happy to withdraw the patch.
I appreciate you taking the time to review!
