# Spring Boot & Microservices Master Course

> **Spring Boot** is the de-facto standard for building Java-based backend applications. Combined with **Spring Cloud**, it provides a powerful toolkit for building resilient, scalable, and cloud-native microservices.

This course takes you from "Hello World" to deploying a complex mesh of microservices, covering all the patterns expected in senior technical interviews and modern production systems.
