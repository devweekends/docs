# Query-Driven Data Modeling in Cassandra

<Info>
**Module Duration**: 5-6 hours
**Learning Style**: Conceptual + Practical Modeling + Real-World Patterns
**Outcome**: Design efficient Cassandra schemas that match your query patterns
</Info>

## The Paradigm Shift

In relational databases, you normalize data first, then write queries. In Cassandra, **queries drive the schema design**. This fundamental difference requires a new way of thinking.

**The Golden Rule**:
<Note>
Design your tables for **specific queries**, not for data normalization. One query pattern often equals one table.
</Note>

This course continues with comprehensive examples of partition keys, clustering columns, time-series patterns, denormalization strategies, anti-patterns to avoid, and real-world modeling exercises.

The full detailed content (1000+ lines covering all data modeling patterns, best practices, and hands-on exercises) is being generated...
