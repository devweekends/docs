## What You'll Master

Apache Hadoop revolutionized big data processing by making distributed computing accessible and reliable. This comprehensive course takes you from foundational concepts to production-ready implementations, following the same architectural principles outlined in the original Google papers (GFS and MapReduce) that inspired Hadoop's design.

You'll gain deep expertise in:

- **Distributed Storage**: HDFS architecture, replication strategies, and fault tolerance mechanisms
- **Parallel Processing**: MapReduce programming model and optimization techniques
- **Resource Management**: YARN architecture and cluster resource orchestration
- **Ecosystem Integration**: Hive, Pig, HBase, and streaming frameworks
- **Production Operations**: Deployment, monitoring, tuning, and troubleshooting at scale

<Note>
This course emphasizes both theoretical foundations (based on seminal distributed systems papers) and practical implementation (production-ready code examples).
