# Apache Flink Mastery

<Info>
**Course Level**: Intermediate to Advanced
**Prerequisites**: Java/Scala basics, distributed systems, streaming concepts
**Duration**: 28-32 hours
**Hands-on Projects**: 18+ real-time streaming projects
</Info>

## What You'll Master

Apache Flink is the industry's leading framework for stateful computations over unbounded and bounded data streams - designed from the ground up for true stream processing (not micro-batching).

You'll gain deep expertise in:

- **Stream Processing Foundations**: Event time vs processing time, watermarks, windowing
- **Stateful Computations**: Managed state, checkpointing, savepoints
- **Exactly-Once Semantics**: Distributed snapshots algorithm (Chandy-Lamport)
- **DataStream API**: Low-level stream processing with full control
- **Table API & SQL**: High-level declarative stream processing
- **CEP (Complex Event Processing)**: Pattern detection in event streams
- **Production Operations**: State backends, deployment, fault tolerance

<Note>
This course covers Flink 1.18+ with emphasis on both streaming fundamentals (from research papers) and production deployments.
